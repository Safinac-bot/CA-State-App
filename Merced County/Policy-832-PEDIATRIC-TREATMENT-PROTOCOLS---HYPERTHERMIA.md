# EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY POLICY NUMBER 832 A Division of the Merced County Department of Public Health SUBJECT: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - HYPERTHERMIA Effective Date 07/2023 Authority: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 4, 1797.220 Initial Date: 11/2018 Review Date: 07/2025 PAGE 1 of 2 Signatures on File Approved By: Tim Williams Ajinder Singh, MD EMS Administrator EMS Medical Director STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE I. DEFINITION Elevated core body temperatures above normal limits, usually caused by prolonged exposure to an excessive heat environment, inadequate fluid intake and the associated fluid loss. HEAT EXHAUSTION - Occurs when a prolonged fluid loss is caused by perspiration, diarrhea or diuretics and exposure to warm to hot heat environment with inadequate fluid and electrolyte replacement. Muscle cramping, dizziness, exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, diaphoresis, normal or slightly elevated body temperature. Syncope and an altered level of consciousness may occur. HEAT STROKE - Loss of thermoregulation function resulting in signs of shock, ALOC, with dry flushed and hot to touch skin, seizures are possible. Core body temperatures above 104°F are common in heat stroke. II. BLS TREATMENT COOLING MEASURES Move patient to a cool environment and provide shade when possible, removing constricted or tight clothing including shoes and socks. OXYGEN As appropriate, goal to maintain SpO2 at least 94%, assist ventilations as necessary. VITALS Assess vitals. TEMPERATURE Assess temperature. BLOOD SUGAR Test glucose and treat as appropriate. CHECK HEAT EXHAUSTION Fluid replacement with water or non-caffeinated sports drink if patient is conscious and able to swallow without difficulty. HEAT STROKE Splash or sponge patient with water. Place cool packs on neck, axillary and COOLING MEASURES groin areas. Promote cooling by fanning (evaporation methods). Subject: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - HYPERTHERMIA Policy Number 832 Page 2 of 2 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE III. ALS TREATMENT MONITOR Treat rhythm as appropriate. IV/IO ACCESS Use appropriate size and administer 20ml/kg fluid bolus for hypotension. MIDAZOLAM If the patient is in status seizures, give 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO (max dose 5 mg) or 0.2 mg/kg IN/IM (max dose 5 mg) if no immediate IV/IO access. Refer to length-based assessment tape or application for drug doses and proper equipment sizes.

# i am keeping same thread cause i want to keep same .md file EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY POLICY NUMBER 834 A Division of the Merced County Department of Public Health SUBJECT: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - HYPOTHERMIA Effective Date 09/2023 Authority: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 4, 1797.220 Initial Date: 11/2018 Review Date: 09/2025 PAGE 1 of 2 Signatures on File Approved By: Tim Williams Ajinder Singh, MD EMS Administrator EMS Medical Director STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE I. DEFINITION LOW BODY TEMPERATURE - 95°F OR LESS MILD 93°F (34° C) to 95° F (35° C) - Shivering, complaint of cold, usually conscious, ALOC, clumsiness, normal blood pressure, or cyanosis. MODERATE 86°F (30° C) to 93°F (34° C) - Confusion, semiconscious, combative, shivering ceases, muscle rigidity, dilated pupils, decreased breathing rate, blood pressure difficult to obtain, V-fib with agitation/sudden movement (handle/move patient gently). SEVERE 86°F (30° C) OR LOWER - Comatose, no rigidity (flaccid), apnea, spontaneous V-fib, the severely hypothermic patient may appear to be clinically dead. Pulse and respirations may need to be checked for longer periods before beginning CPR (up to 60 seconds). II. BLS TREATMENT OXYGEN As appropriate. Keep SpO2 at least 94%, assist ventilations as necessary. VITALS Assess vitals and check for pulse up to 60 seconds. TEMPERATURE Assess temperature. BLOOD SUGAR Test blood glucose, if less than 80 mg/dl refer to EMS Policy \#824 Pediatric CHECK Treatment Protocols – Altered Loss of Consciousness (ALOC) or Syncope. WARMING Remove wet clothing. If patient requires moving, be gentle. Avoid MEASURES unnecessary movement or rubbing. Cover patient with blanket to prevent heat loss, keep patient horizontal. Initiate CPR as needed. Subject: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - HYPOTHERMIA Policy Number 834 Page 2 of 2 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE III. ALS TREATMENT MONITOR Treat rhythm as appropriate. If patient is pulseless/apneic initiate CPR. Limit defibrillation of V-fib/V-tach to one shock. Once the temperature is GREATER THAN 86° F (30° C) defibrillate V-fib/V-tach as necessary. VASCULAR ACCESS Administer warm IV fluids; administer 20 ml/kg fluid bolus for hypotension. Withhold IV medication until the temperature is GREATER THAN 86° F (30° C). DEXTROSE If blood glucose is less than 80 mg/dl administer IV/IO Dextrose as follows: • D10 - 5 ml/kg, • D25 - 2 ml/kg (If D10 is not available). • May repeat in 3-5 minutes if altered mental status persists and repeat blood glucose is less than 80 mg/dl. GLUCAGON If blood sugar is less than 80 mg/dl and no IV/IO access administer Glucagon as follows: • If less than 20 kg 0.5 mg (0.5 ml) IM. May repeat after 3-5 minutes if no improvement • If greater than 20 kg 1 mg IM. May repeat after 3-5 minutes if no improvement Refer to length-based assessment tape or application for drug doses, energy settings and proper equipment sizes.
