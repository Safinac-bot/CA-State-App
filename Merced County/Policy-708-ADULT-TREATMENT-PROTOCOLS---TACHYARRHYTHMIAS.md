# EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY POLICY NUMBER 708 A Division of the Merced County Department of Public Health SUBJECT: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - TACHYARRHYTHMIAS Effective Date 04/2024 Authority: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 4, 1797.220 Initial Date: 07/2022 Review Date: 04/2026 PAGE 1 of 3 Signatures on File Approved By: Tim Williams Ajinder Singh, MD EMS Administrator EMS Medical Director STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE I. DEFINITION Symptomatic tachycardia is defined by the following: • Heart rate above 150 beats/minute • Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) below 90 mmHg • Associated signs and symptoms including ALOC, signs of shock, chest pain, acute pulmonary edema, syncope, extreme weakness • ECG rhythms will have no “P” waves (both wide and narrow QRS) Do not confuse Sinus Tachycardia with Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT). If patient presents in Sinus Tachycardia look for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or shock and correct the cause. II. BLS TREATMENT OXYGEN As appropriate, goal to maintain SpO2 at least 94%, assist ventilations as necessary. VITALS Assess vitals. BLOOD SUGAR For patients who have ALOC, test blood glucose and if less than 60 mg/dl, CHECK treat per EMS Policy \#724 Adult Altered Level of Conscious (ALOC) – Syncope III. ALS TREATMENT MONITOR Perform a 12-Lead ECG within 10 minutes of patient contact. If the 12-Lead ECG reads STEMI or Acute MI or an equivalent; transmit the 12-Lead ECG to appropriate STEMI Receiving Center. Post conversion, obtain a 12-Lead ECG. VASCULAR ACCESS IV/IO rate as appropriate, if patient has a systolic BP less than 90 mmHg administer 250 ml fluid boluses to systolic BP greater than 90 mmHg. Reassess patient after each bolus assessing for signs of fluid overload. Subject: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - TACHYARRHYTHMIAS Policy Number 708 Page 2 of 3 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE CAPNOGRAPHY Utilize waveform capnography; EtCO2 readings of 25 mmHg or less are suggestive of poor organ perfusion. SINUS TACHYCARDIA • With no associated signs or symptoms of extremis o Consider IV/IO fluid bolus and look for underlying causes (dehydration, sepsis, shock) • If the patient is unstable perform immediate synchronized cardioversion o SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION  If heart rate greater than 150 and the patient is unstable perform immediate synchronized cardioversion.  100 joules, 200 joules, 360 joules or biphasic equivalent. SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT) • With associated signs or symptoms of extremis o VALSALVA MANEUVER  If heart rate greater than 150 with narrow QRS complexes and regular rate, perform a vagal maneuver. o ADENOSINE  6 mg rapid IV push over 1 second followed by 10-20 ml saline flush.  If patient does not convert in 2 minutes, repeat adenosine with 12 mg rapid IV push over 1 second followed by 10-20 ml saline flush.  If the patient does not convert, a repeat dose of 12 mg may be administered in 1 minute. o SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION  If the patient is unstable perform immediate synchronized cardioversion.  100 joules, 200 joules, 360 joules or biphasic equivalent. VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (VT) • With no associated signs or symptoms of extremis o Consider IV/IO fluid bolus and look for underlying causes. • If the patient is unstable perform immediate synchronized cardioversion o SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION  If heart rate greater than 150 and the patient is unstable perform immediate synchronized cardioversion.  100 joules, 200 joules, 360 joules or biphasic equivalent. o Successful Cardioversion  Amiodarone 150 mg infusion over 10 minutes OR  Lidocaine 0.5 mg/kg, repeat every 10 minutes to maximum dose of 3 mg/kg.  Magnesium Sulfate 2 gms in 10 ml saline slow IV push over 2 minutes. TORSADES DE POINTE POLYMORPHIC (WIDE COMPLEX) • With no associated signs or symptoms of extremis  Magnesium Sulfate 2 gms in 10 ml saline slow IV push over 2 minutes. Subject: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - TACHYARRHYTHMIAS Policy Number 708 Page 3 of 3 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE • If the patient is unstable  Biphasic manual defibrillation – start at 200 j equivalents, increase energy as needed. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION • Irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Ventricular rate usually less than 200 o SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION  If heart rate greater than 150 and the patient is unstable perform immediate synchronized cardioversion.  100 joules, 200 joules, 360 joules or biphasic equivalent. Patients that need sedation or pain control to tolerate synchronized cardioversion consider using one of the following: • Sedation  Midazolam 2-5 mg IV/IO • Pain Management  Morphine 2-5 mg IV/IO OR  Fentanyl 20 to 50 mcg IV/IO NOTE: If at any time the monitor will not synchronize with the rhythm, and the patient is unstable, perform immediate defibrillation.

Policy Number 708 (Adult Treatment Protocols – Tachyarrhythmias) has now been appended in your 700 series section, maintaining structure and clarity. This protocol details the recognition and management of sinus tachycardia, SVT, VT, Torsades, and atrial fibrillation, outlining BLS and ALS interventions, synchronized cardioversion, medication dosing, and special considerations.
