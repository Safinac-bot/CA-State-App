DEFINITION ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS Acute respiratory distress can have many causes: • ASTHMA / BRONCHOLITIS – Typically present with diffuse wheezes, rhonchi, tachypnea, pursed lips, accessory muscle use (tracheal tugging, intercostal retractions, tripod positioning) and cyanosis to lips and nails. • CROUP – Occurs mostly at night during the fall and winter. History: Mild cold or other infection. Indications includes patients are generally between 6 months and 4 years, harsh barking cough, inspiratory stridor, nasal flaring, and tracheal tugging. • EPIGLOTTITIS – History of mild upper respiratory infection. Tends to occur in patients between age 3 to 6, but 25% of all cases occur in children less than 2 years of age. History and Physical Exam – High fever, sore throat, pain on swallowing, shallow breathing, dyspnea, inspiratory stridor, drooling and a red swollen epiglottis. (DO NOT attempt to visualize airway, if the patient is crying the epiglottis may be visible posterior to the base of the tongue.) Place patient in position of comfort, usually in parents lap or arms. Allow parent to accompany the child to the hospital to ease child’s fears. Minimize handling and examination to prevent crying and agitation. Avoid laying the patient down to prevent and epiglottis from falling back and completely obstructing the airway. • POSSIBLE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTIONS INCLUDING STRIDOR – Refer to EMS Policy \#812 Pediatric Treatment Protocols - Airway Obstructions. Please note that in patients who are experiencing severe bronchospasm, the breath sounds may sound clear, yet diminished. This is due to a decreased tidal volume and not moving enough air to create audible wheezing, these patients need respiratory assistance. Remember to do a complete assessment (ABC’s) on all respiratory distress patients.
