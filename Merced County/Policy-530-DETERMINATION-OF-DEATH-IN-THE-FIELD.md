PURPOSE To provide criteria and guidance to prehospital personnel on determining death in the prehospital setting and procedures to be followed whenever Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is not initiated or is discontinued in the prehospital setting in Merced County. II. POLICY A. Determination of OBVIOUS Death in the Field - Merced County EMS Providers may determine OBVIOUS DEATH in the field has occurred when: 1. There is absence of respirations, cardiac activity, and neurologic reflexes, in addition to one or more of the following conditions: a. Decapitation b. Incineration of the torso or head c. Massive crush injury d. Exposure, destruction and/or separation of vital internal organs (e.g., brain, spinal cord, liver, heart, or lungs) from the body e. Blunt traumatic arrests without organized (VF, V-Tach, or PEA) ECG activity or with extrication times exceeding fifteen (15) minutes f. Drowning victims when it is reasonably assumed that the submersion has been greater than sixty (60) minutes g. Postmortem lividity and/or rigor mortis h. Decomposition of body tissue 2. Prehospital personnel shall make Determination of Death and note the time on the Prehospital Care Report Form (PCR). If not already on scene, prehospital personnel shall notify the County Coroner and/or the appropriate law enforcement agency that there is an OBVIOUS DEATH and shall remain at the scene until released by the coroner or law enforcement agency. The completed PCR shall be made available to the Merced County Coroner’s office as soon as possible. B. Determination Death in the Field - For patients who do not meet the criteria of OBVIOUS DEATH, EMS Personnel shall initiate and continue CPR and Advanced Life Support (ALS) treatment protocols until one of the following occurs: Subject: DETERMINATION OF DEATH IN THE FIELD Policy Number 530 Page 2 of 3 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE 1. Spontaneous effective circulation and ventilation have been restored. 2. The resuscitative effort has been transferred to another responsible and properly trained individual who continues it. 3. The rescuer is physically exhausted and unable to continue. 4. Patients shall have resuscitative efforts performed for the following time periods. 5. Patients presenting with an initial ECG rhythm of Asystole or a Paced rhythm AND an EtCO₂ of 10 mmHg or less, ten (10) minutes of ALS care must be performed. If there is no improvement in the patient’s condition, the paramedic may make determination of death in the field without Base Hospital contact. 6. Patients presenting with an initial ECG rhythm of Asystole, PEA, or a Paced rhythm AND an EtCO₂ of 11 mmHg or greater – twenty (20) minutes of ALS care must be performed. If there is no improvement in the patient’s condition, the paramedic may make determination of death in the field without Base Hospital Contact. 7. Patients presenting with an initial ECG rhythm of V-Fib/pulseless V-Tach or patients who received a defibrillation from an AED – thirty (30) minutes of ALS care must be performed. If the patient achieves ROSC, transport the patient to the closest STEMI center if patient condition allows. If patient condition does not improve after thirty (30) minutes, the paramedic may make determination of death in the field without Base Hospital Contact. 8. Pediatric Patients - If no reversable causes are identified and ALS treatment have been performed for 30 minutes. PARAMEDICS MAY MAKE BASE HOSPITAL CONTACT AT ANY TIME FOR A PHYSICIAN CONSULT IF NECESSARY. C. BLS Personnel (Public Safety First-Aid) Termination of CPR in a Medical Patient. 1. Any case in which information becomes available that would have prevented initiation of CPR had that information been available before CPR was initiated, CPR should be terminated. 2. After CPR for ten (10) minutes, determine ALS unit’s estimated time of arrival. a. If less than 10 minutes to ALS arrival, continue CPR. b. If greater than 10 minutes to ALS arrival, and no shock advised or administered with an AED, discontinue CPR and cancel incoming ALS response. c. BLS personnel must complete two primary assessments, which show no signs of life one minute apart before terminating CPR. Assessments must be confirmed by two (2) EMS providers. Subject: DETERMINATION OF DEATH IN THE FIELD Policy Number 530 Page 3 of 3 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE Termination of CPR in a Trauma Patient. 1. Briefly assess the patient and determine if the injury is compatible with life. If injury is incompatible with life, do not initiate CPR and cancel incoming ALS response. 2. Initiate CPR and assess the patient's mechanism of injury (Blunt vs. Penetrating). a. Blunt trauma arrest 1) Determine if the ALS unit is greater than five (5) minutes away. If greater than five (5) minutes away, terminate CPR and cancel incoming ALS response. BLS personnel must complete two primary assessments, which show no signs of life one minute apart before terminating CPR. Assessments must be confirmed by two (2) EMS providers. 2) CPR and other BLS care should be continued if an ALS unit is less than five (5) minutes away. b. Penetrating trauma arrest 1) Determine if the ALS unit is greater than ten (10) minutes away. If greater than ten (10) minutes away, terminate CPR and cancel incoming ALS response. BLS personnel must complete two primary assessments, which show no signs of life one minute apart before terminating CPR. Assessments must be confirmed by two (2) EMS providers. 2) CPR and other BLS care should be continued if an ALS unit is less than ten (10) minutes away.

Policy Number 530 (Determination of Death in the Field), covering criteria and guidance for determination and documentation of death, as well as procedures for both ALS and BLS prehospital providers, has now been appended and is clearly separated within your 500 series protocols section.
