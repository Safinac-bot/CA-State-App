DEFINITION Symptomatic tachycardia is defined by the following: • Heart rate above: o 220 - Infants (less than 2 years of age) o 180 - Toddlers (ages 2 years and greater) • Systolic Blood Pressure - Hypotensive verified by length-based assessment tape or application • Associated signs and symptoms including ALOC, signs of shock, chest pain, acute pulmonary edema, syncope, extreme weakness • ECG rhythms will have no P-waves (both wide and narrow QRS) • Do not confuse Sinus Tachycardia with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). If a patient has Sinus Tachycardia look for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or shock and correct the cause. II. BLS TREATMENT OXYGEN As appropriate, goal is to maintain SpO2 at least 94%, secure airway and assist ventilations as necessary. VITALS Assess vital signs frequently, every 5 minutes if hypotensive. BLOOD SUGAR Test glucose and treat as appropriate per EMS Policy \#824 Pediatric CHECK Treatment Protocols – Altered Level Of Consciences (ALOC) Or Syncope. CHECK III. ALS TREATMENT MONITOR Treat arrhythmias as appropriate. VASCULAR ACCESS If patient is hypotensive, establish two (2) large bore IV/IO’s and administer 20 ml/kg bolus. Reassess patient after bolus. Repeat if necessary at 10 ml/kg bolus up to a total of 40 ml/kg max has been administered. Subject: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS – TACHYCARDIA Policy Number 808 Page 2 of 2 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE CAPNOGRAPHY Utilize waveform capnography; EtCO2 readings of 25 mmHg or less are suggestive of poor organ perfusion. NARROW COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA • With no associated signs or symptoms of extremis o Consider IV/IO fluid bolus and look for underlying causes (dehydration, sepsis, shock) • With associated signs or symptoms of extremis o SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION  If the patient is unstable perform immediate synchronized cardioversion  1 joules/kg or biphasic equivalent  If no response, repeat at 2 joules/kg or biphasic equivalent WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA • With no associated signs or symptoms of extremis o Consider IV/IO fluid bolus and look for underlying causes (dehydration, sepsis, shock) • With associated signs or symptoms of extremis o SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION  If the patient is unstable perform immediate synchronized cardioversion  1 joules/kg or biphasic equivalent  If no response, repeat at 2 joules/kg or biphasic equivalent Patients that need sedation or pain control to tolerate synchronized cardioversion consider using one of the following: • Sedation  Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO • Pain Management  Morphine 0.1 mg/kg of IV/IO or  Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg of IV/IO If the patient has narrow complex tachycardia with mild symptoms and no response to IV/IO fluids, consider Adenosine. BASE HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN ORDERS ONLY ADENOSINE Administer 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO (max 6 mg) followed by 20 ml flush. If patient does not convert, administer 0.2 mg/kg IV/IO (max 12 mg) followed by 20 ml flush. NOTE: If at any time the monitor will not synchronize with the rhythm, and the patient is unstable, perform immediate defibrillation.
