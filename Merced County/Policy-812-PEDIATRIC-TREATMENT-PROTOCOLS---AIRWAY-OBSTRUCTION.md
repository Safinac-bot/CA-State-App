NEEDLE ● Position patient supine CRICOTHYROTOMY ● Identify and clean cricothyroid membrane between thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage with povidone-iodine and alcohol. ● With finger marking cricothyroid membrane, stabilize the trachea. ● Insert a 10-gauge IV catheter with a syringe attached at a 45° angle towards the patient's feet through the membrane while aspirating. ● Aspiration of air indicates entry into the trachea. ● Withdraw the needle, attach a cut 3 mm endotracheal tube, and ventilate with BVM. ● Secure tube and manually stabilize through transport. ● Assess and reassess lung sounds.
