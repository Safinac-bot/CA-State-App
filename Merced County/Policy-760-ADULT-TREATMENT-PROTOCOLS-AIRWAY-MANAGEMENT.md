# EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY POLICY NUMBER 760 A Division of the Merced County Department of Public Health SUBJECT: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS – AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Effective Date 01/2025 Authority: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 4, 1797.220 Initial Date: 09/2018 Review Date: 01/2027 PAGE 1 of 4 Signatures on File Approved By: Tim Williams Ajinder Singh, MD EMS Administrator EMS Medical Director STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE I. DEFINITIONS Endotracheal Tube (ETT) – Field intubation is the placement of an advanced airway (ETT) in the trachea with the aid of a laryngoscope. This is an emergency procedure performed by paramedics on patients who are unconscious or who can’t breathe on their own. Endotracheal intubation (ETT) is the standard for airway control in the prehospital setting when other BLS airway adjuncts (BVM, etc.) cannot protect the patients airway. Supraglottic Airway Device (SAD) – A device that is placed into the oral pharynx and subsequently placed over the glottic opening. This is done in a blind fashion without the aid of a laryngoscope. This will aid in the oxygenation and ventilation of the patient. The i-gel (SAD) is a device that has been approved by the Merced County EMS Agency. II. PURPOSE The purpose of this policy is to define training standards, criteria, and procedures for the use of the Endotracheal Tube (ETT) by paramedics for adult patients 15 years of age or older and Supraglottic Airway Device (SAD). These devices are to be utilized when BVM ventilation is not adequate. If an Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) completes an approved Optional Scope of Practice training program and submits the appropriate documentation to Merced County EMS Agency, they may use the SAD on patients 12 years of age or older. III. POLICY Oral endotracheal intubation, stomal endotracheal intubation, and placement of an I-Gel (Supraglottic airway) as a rescue airway are standing orders for patients who require advanced airway management. IV. ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION A. Indications 1. Adult patients 15 years of age or older in cardiac or respiratory arrest. 2. Spontaneously breathing adult patients with GCS of 8 or less, who are unable to maintain their own airway or without gag reflex. Subject: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Policy Number 760 Page 2 of 4 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE 3. Spontaneously breathing adult patients with a GCS of 8 or less who have a respiratory rate less than 8 per minute. B. Contraindications 1. Pediatric patients, 14 years of age or less. NOTE: Pediatric endotracheal intubation is not an approved skill for Paramedics. 2. The patient in respiratory arrest from a suspected narcotic overdose should not be intubated until AFTER administration of Naloxone. 3. Nasal endotracheal intubation is not a Merced County EMS Agency approved skill for Paramedics. C. Procedure 1. Prepare, position, and oxygenate the patient with 100% oxygen. 2. Evaluate for difficult airway. 3. Select proper ETT and stylet. 4. The use of a Bougie device is required with all ETT intubation attempts. 5. Intubate the trachea via direct laryngeal visualization. 6. Inflate ETT cuff. 7. Verify placement using ALL the following: a. Rise and fall of the chest b. Bilateral breath sounds c. Negative epigastric sounds d. Condensation in the tube e. Continuous waveform EtCO2 (Application within one (1) minute) 8. Secure with commercial tube holder. 9. The number of centimeters at which the tube is secured, confirmatory indicators, and color change or waveform reading must be documented in the Prehospital Care Report. 10. All intubated patients must be continuously assessed using EtCO2 waveform capnography. 11. Any significant movement, emesis, or change in clinical condition should be reassessed using waveform capnography and physical examination. 12. If at any time, capnography indicates that the tube is not in communication with the trachea, the airway must be immediately removed, and reintubation attempted. Subject: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Policy Number 760 Page 3 of 4 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE 13. Do not make more than two (2) attempts total per patient to perform endotracheal intubation. An attempt to intubate is defined as placement of the laryngoscope blade in a patient's mouth with the intent to intubate. If either unsuccessful after 2 attempts, or intubation not felt possible, insert an i-gel, or use BLS airway techniques. V. SUPRAGLOTTIC AIRWAY DEVICE (SAD) A. Indications 1. Cardiac arrest 2. Respiratory arrest with no immediate reversible cause (i.e., hypoglycemia or opioid overdose overdose). 3. Adult patients in need of an advanced airway and/or unable to be adequately ventilated with a BVM when endotracheal intubation is unavailable or unsuccessful. 4. Adult patients in need of rapid advanced airway control when endotracheal intubation is anticipated to be difficult. 5. EMT Optional Scope of Practice - Patients, 12 years of age or older, in need of airway protection or unable to be adequately ventilated by BVM. B. Contraindications 1. Intact gag reflex 2. Severe airway trauma 3. Esophageal burns from caustics 4. Complete airway obstruction 5. Trismus 6. Oral trauma (relative) 7. Esophageal disease C. Complications 1. Airway trauma 2. Regurgitation 3. Aspiration Subject: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Policy Number 760 Page 4 of 4 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE 4. Direct trauma to esophagus D. Procedure 1. Pre-oxygenate with 100% oxygen 2. Select appropriately sized SAD 3. Have suction available and ready to use 4. Apply chin lift and introduce the SAD into the mouth 5. Follow the curvature of the airway while pushing the SAD until the SAD stops 6. Attach BVM and ventilate 7. Verify placement using ALL the following: a. Rise and fall of the chest b. Bilateral breath sounds c. Negative epigastric sounds d. Condensation in the tube e. Continuous waveform EtCO2 (Paramedic) or colorimetric CO2 detector f(EMTOS) (Application within one (1) minute) 8. Any significant movement, emesis or change in clinical condition should be reassessed using waveform capnography or colorimetric CO2 detector, and physical examination. 9. If, at any time, capnography or colorimetric CO2 detector indicates that the SAD is not in communication with the trachea, the airway must be immediately removed and attempted again. E. Training Requirements - Supraglottic Airway Device (SAD) 1. Complete an approved Merced County EMS Agency class using the approved training and skill competencies documents. 2. Make skill competencies documents available to Merced County EMS Agency upon request.
