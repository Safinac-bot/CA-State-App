Double clamp the cord at approximately 7” and 10” from baby’s navel and cut between clamps. • Wrap the infant in a blanket and put the baby to the mother’s breast to nurse and keep warm. II. BLS TREATMENT HEART RATE 100 OR GREATER OXYGEN Suction airway as needed, administer blow by oxygen as necessary. VITALS Assess respirations and pulse every minute. TEMPERATURE Keep baby warm. HEART RATE BETWEEN 80 - 100 STIMULATE Vigorously rub and dry infant. OXYGEN Suction airway as needed. Administer 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask, assist ventilations if necessary.
