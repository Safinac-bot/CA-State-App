Refer to length-based assessment tape for normal vital signs. ASSESS NEED FOR Refer to EMS Policy \#750 Spinal Motion Restriction for proper application SPINAL MOTION of SMR. RESTRICTION (SMR) BLEEDING CONTROL Stop active bleeding with direct pressure, hemostatic dressings, and/or if necessary, apply a tourniquet.

Age-appropriate hypotension - per length-based assessment tape C. Respiratory rate outside of normal limits – per length-based assessment tape D. Penetrating injury to the head, neck, or trunk E. Patient < 1 year of age with any visible fractures F. Open and depressed skull fractures G. Flail chest H. Traumatic paralysis I. Unstable pelvic fracture J. Two or more proximal long bone fractures K. Paramedic judgement 1. Paramedic judgment should include a consideration of the mechanism of injury and be based on tangible signs and/or symptoms indicating possible internal injury or compensated blood loss, such as: a) Anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, confusion b) Tachycardia c) Pallor, cool skin, diaphoresis, trembling d) Chest or abdominal pain following an acute traumatic event
