# EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY POLICY NUMBER 860 A Division of the Merced County Department of Public Health SUBJECT: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS – AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Effective Date 04/2024 Authority: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 4, 1797.220 Initial Date: 11/2006 Review Date: 04/2026 PAGE 1 of 4 Signatures on File Approved By: Tim Williams Ajinder Singh, MD EMS Administrator EMS Medical Director STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE I. DEFINITIONS Supraglottic Airway Device (SAD) – A device that is placed into the oral pharynx and subsequently placed over the glottic opening. This is done in a blind fashion without the aid of a laryngoscope. This will aid in the oxygenation and ventilation of the pediatric patient. The i-gel (SAD) is a device that has been approved by the Merced County EMS Agency. II. PURPOSE To provide guidelines in the proper utilization and performance of advanced airway management of pediatric patients, equal to or less than 14 years in age or that fits onto length-based assessment tape or application. If an Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) completes an approved Optional Scope of Practice training program and submits the appropriate documentation to MCEMSA, they may use a SAD on patients 12 years of age or older. Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Failure is rarely a sudden event, but rather is usually the end-result of a progressive deterioration in respiratory, and in the later stages, circulatory function. It is therefore imperative that field personnel provide a thorough assessment of the child's respiratory function. Early Assessment and Early Aggressive Intervention is the key to effective intervention in preventable cardiopulmonary failure and arrest in pediatrics. III. POLICY Paramedics shall use the guidelines contained herein in the management of pediatric patients presenting with respiratory distress. IV. SUPRAGLOTTIC AIRWAY DEVICE (SAD) Paramedics may utilize the approved SAD as a primary advanced airway device for patients weighing equal to or greater than 2 kgs. A. Indications 1. Cardiac arrest Subject: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS – AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Policy Number 860 Page 2 of 4 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE 2. Respiratory arrest with no immediate reversible cause (i.e., hypoglycemia or opioid overdose overdose). 3. Patients in need of an advanced airway and/or unable to be adequately ventilated with a BVM. 4. EMT Optional Scope of Practice - Patients, 12 years of age or older, in need of airway protection or unable to be adequately ventilated by BVM. B. Contraindications 1. Intact gag reflex 2. Severe airway trauma 3. Esophageal burns from caustics 4. Complete airway obstruction 5. Trismus 6. Oral trauma (relative) 7. Esophageal disease C. Complications 1. Airway trauma 2. Regurgitation 3. Aspiration 4. Direct trauma to esophagus V. Procedure It must be emphasized that proper and early use of high concentration O2 can often resolve respiratory distress in children. In cases of inadequate ventilatory rate or volume, AGGRESSIVE BLS TECHNIQUES (BVM with BLS airway adjuncts and 100% O2) are, in most cases, adequate to provide the necessary ventilatory assistance. A. Assessment - Cardiopulmonary failure/arrest should be anticipated in children presenting with any of the following: 1. Tachypnea (relative to age) 2. Bradypnea (particularly ominous) Subject: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS – AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Policy Number 860 Page 3 of 4 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE 3. Diminished level of consciousness or response to pain: a. Difficult to arouse, lethargy. b. Child > two months fails to recognize parents (often described by parents as simply "something wrong"). 4. Cyanosis (is a late and inconsistent sign): a. If present in mucous membranes of mouth or nailbeds, usually a respiratory component. b. If present only in extremities, usually circulatory failure. 5. Poor skeletal muscle tone. 6. Increased respiratory effort: a. Nasal flaring. b. Intercostal, subcostal /or suprasternal inspiratory retractions. c. Head bobbing, grunting, stridor, or prolonged expiration (pursed lips i.e., auto PEEP). B. Placement 1. Pre-oxygenate with 100% oxygen. 2. Select Appropriately sized SAD. 3. Have suction available and ready to use. 4. Apply chin lift and introduce the SAD into the mouth. 5. Follow the curvature of the airway while pushing the SAD until the SAD stops. 6. Attach BVM and ventilate. 7. Verify placement using ALL the following: a. Rise and fall of the chest. b. Bilateral breath sounds. c. Negative epigastric sounds. d. Condensation in the tube. e. Continuous waveform EtCO2 for Paramedic or colorimetric CO2 detector for EMT- OS. 8. Any significant movement, emesis, or change in clinical condition should be reassessed using waveform capnography or colorimetric CO2 detector, and physical examination. 9. If, at any time, capnography or colorimetric CO2 detector indicates that the SAD is not in communication with the trachea, the airway must be immediately removed, and attempted again. NOTE: Fatigue must be considered. An infant with tachypnea will tire. A decreasing respiratory rate under these circumstances is an ominous sign. Subject: PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS – AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Policy Number 860 Page 4 of 4 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE C. Endotracheal Intubation (ETT) of a pediatric patient is not an approved skill for Paramedics. D. Only FP-C / CCP-C or a CFRN (or other CAMTS approved RN specialty certification) that works for a CAMTS (Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems) accredited program or equivalent, may perform ETT of a pediatric patient.

# next are 900 series keee organizationt the same. we are almost done.3 more policiesEMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY POLICY NUMBER 910 A Division of the Merced County Department of Public Health SUBJECT: MULTIPLE CASUALTY INCIDENT (MCI) – FIELD OPERATIONS Effective Date 07/2024 Authority: California Health and Safety Code Division 2.5 Sections 1797.220 and 1797.252 California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Sections 100063 and 100146 FIRESCOPE Fire Service Field Operations Guide ICS 420-1 (2022) California Code of Regulations (SEMS), Title 19, Division 2, Section 2400 2400 Government Code Section 8607 (a) Initial Date: 10/2003 Review Date: 07/2026 PAGE 1 of 7 Signatures on File Approved By: Tim Williams Ajinder Singh, MD EMS Administrator EMS Medical Director STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE I. PURPOSE To establish the standards for prehospital personnel in providing care during a declared Multi-Casualty Incident and to provide effective coordination and communications among incident responders, dispatch centers, area hospitals, EMS Agency Staff, Emergency Operations Center's (EOC), and local/state/ federal agencies through the provision of standardized medical response policies and procedures. This policy attempts to provide the necessary information for a rapid response, treatment and transport of victims and patients by describing the roles, relationships, and responsibilities of responding personnel, dispatch centers, and hospitals. II. POLICY All Multiple Casualty Incident operations within Merced County shall follow the Incident Command System and the procedures established herein. All medical resource requests shall be coordinated with the Incident Commander. III. PROCEDURE A.

B. MCI Alert to Disaster Control Facility (DCF) An MCI alert to the Base Hospital, Mercy Medical Center which serves as the county’s disaster control facility, should occur as soon as there is information that an MCI may exist (pre-alert).

Triage Tag Number (last 4 digits) b. Age c. Patient Care Priority Designation (color) d. Chief Complaint e. Patient Destination f. Transporting Ambulance Number I. Communications During an MCI, it is essential that all radio/phone transmissions be kept to a minimum. To ensure adequate radio/phone time, the following guidelines shall be adhered to: 1. During transport – updates with the DCF by transporting units will only be made if there is a Subject: MULTIPLE CASUALTY INCIDENT (MCI) – FIELD OPERATIONS Policy Number 910 Page 4 of 7 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE change (worsening) in the patients triage category. 2. All Other System Radio/Phone Traffic: a. Only that communication which is necessary for patient/personal safety or operational integrity shall be conducted during an MCI. b.
