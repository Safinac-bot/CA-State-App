Revised September 22, 2008 Emergency Medical Services Quality Improvement Program (EQIP) Template Submitted byCalifornia Local EMS Agency QI Coordinators 2008 2 Instructions and Notes 1. This EMS QI Plan (EQIP) Template is meant to guide you through the process of writing a QI Program that meets the minimum requirements set by the California Code of Regulations,, Title XXII, Chapter 12, which can be accessed on the Emergency Medical Services Authority website at [www.emsa.ca.gov/laws/files/ch12_emsqi_101004.pdf](https://www.emsa.ca.gov/laws/files/ch12_emsqi_101004.pdf) . Anyone wishing to exceed these requirements or to customize the QI Program to your individual organization is encouraged to do so, as long as the minimum requirements are still met. 2. The EQIP shall be in accordance with the Emergency Medical Services System Quality Improvement Program Model Guidelines (Rev. 3/04), hereinafter referred to as the Model Guidelines. The Model Guidelines can be accessed on the EMSA website at [www.emsa.ca.gov/pubs/pdf/emsa166.pdf](https://www.emsa.ca.gov/pubs/pdf/emsa166.pdf). 3. Although it is understood that resources, both financial and personnel are scarce for some organizations, it is expected that all providers will be compliant with the California EMS Information System (CEMSIS) data standards. The goal is to be level III CEMSIS compliant to ensure standardization in the data collection processes. 4. For those organizations wishing to exceed CEMSIS compliance, or who wish to monitor an element not contained in CEMSIS, please look to the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) data dictionary to see if the data element you wish to monitor is there. If it is located in NEMSIS, it should be used as stated in NEMSIS and the EMSA should be notified so the element can be included in the next version of CEMSIS. If the desired element is not found in CEMSIS or NEMSIS the element should be developed collaboratively to allow for consistent quality improvement. 5. Data will be submitted in accordance with LEMSA policies, protocols, and procedures, as well as CEMSIS and NEMSIS data standards1. 6. Submit one paper copy of your Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Quality Improvement Program (EQIP) to your LEMSA by the appropriate deadline. In your cover letter, please include the contact name and e-mail address, and phone number of the QI Program contact person at your agency. 7. Describe your current or planned approaches that respond to each item. If your current approaches are incomplete with respect to the item, work with your QI Team, Technical Advisory Group, or other appropriate person(s) to develop a complete approach that you intend to utilize, and describe it in your program. It is acceptable to describe your current approach and your planned future approach. 8. Responses to the items should be real and practical, not theoretical. In your responses, specify how your organization will meet the item requirement, on what timeframe, involving what participants (job title), and using what data. 9. If your organization has a QI Plan or other documents describing responses needed in your program, you may attach such documentation and identify page numbers and paragraphs that respond to questions in this QI Template. 10. Program length guideline: maximum 20 pages. This is not a “hard” rule, but a guideline. It is permissible to use diagrams, flowcharts, tables, other graphical depictions, and/or narrative descriptions. 11. The Table of Contents below will automatically insert pages numbers using the Word software style “Headings” in this document. If you change the Headings or style of font, the automatic feature will be disabled. To update your Table of Contents, place your cursor anywhere in the table below and press F9 on your computer. Select “Update entire table.” You may delete these italicized Instructions and Notes before you submit your EQIP. 1 If you add an element not included in CEMSIS, NEMSIS, or the Model Guidelines, or if it is not included as part of a trial study, the element must be defined at the local level and included in your annual EQIP update.
