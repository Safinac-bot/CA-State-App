IV. PROCEDURE A. A PCR shall be completed for the following: 1. All patients who are transported by ambulance from a field scene, nursing facility or a medical facility to a facility of higher care for the purpose of non-prescheduled diagnosis and treatment. 2. All patients who are transported from one hospital to another hospital for the purpose of continuation of treatment. 3. In all cases of prehospital death, a completed original PCR shall be made available to the County Coroner with jurisdiction over the scene as soon as possible. 4. When an ALS Field Supervisor arrives on scene, providing an assessment and medical treatment prior to the responding assigned ambulance arriving at the scene. 5. In all cases where patient contact is made but the patient is refusing assessment, treatment and/or transportation.

For disaster or multi-casualty incidents, the PCR shall contain complete patient information and treatment, which is to include the Triage Tag number and the patient's original triage priority, including any subsequent priority changes during triage. 7. A completed PCR shall be provided to the hospital prior to the ambulance leaving the hospital unless the ambulance is requested for another EMS call. If the ambulance has to leave prior to leaving a PCR, the PCR has to be made available to the receiving facility within 24 hours of when the patient was delivered to the hospital. Subject: PATIENT DOCUMENTATION Policy Number 540 Page 3 of 5 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE B. Patient Documentation 1. Personnel providing patient care are responsible for accurately documenting all available and relevant patient information on the PCR. This requirement includes transport and first responder personnel. 2. Use of usual and customary abbreviations is permitted in the narrative section of the PCR. 3. An EMS provider’s PCR should include, at a minimum the following information: a. Complete demographic information. b. A clear history of the present illness with chief complaint, onset time, associated complaints, pertinent negatives, mechanism of injury, etc. The information should accurately reflect the patient’s chief complaint as stated by the patient to the EMS provider and should be sufficient to refresh the clinical situation after it has faded from memory. c. An appropriate physical assessment that includes all relevant portions of a head-to-toe physical exam. When appropriate, this information may be supplemented in the narrative section of the PCR. d. At least two (2) complete sets of vital signs for every patient including: pulse, respirations, blood pressure and pulse oximetry. End Tidal Capnography (EtCO2) if applied per protocol. These vital signs should be repeated and documented after drug administration, prior to patient transfer and as needed during transport. Vital signs should be taken and documented: • Every five (5) minutes for a Stat Patient • Every fifteen (15) minutes Non-Stat Patient For children < three (3) years of age, blood pressure measurement is not required for all patients, but should be measured, if possible, especially in critically ill patients in whom blood pressure measurement may guide treatment decisions. If unable to obtain (UTO) any vital signs, the reason must be documented. e. A pain scale shall be documented for all patients. f. The CAD to EHR interface embedded within the EHR system should be used to populate all EHR data fields it supplies. When 9-1-1 center times were improperly recorded, these may be properly edited. g. When the cardiac monitor is applied, data will be transferred to the PCR from the device. If transferred automated vital sign values do not correlate with manually obtained values, or are not consistent with the patient’s clinical condition, providers should manually check vitals and record manual results. Subject: PATIENT DOCUMENTATION Policy Number 540 Page 4 of 5 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE h. Document all drug administrations, drug dosage, route administered, time administered and patient response(s) to the medication. All blood pressure dependent medications / procedures shall have vitals documented at least five (5) minutes pre/post medication administration. i. Document a complete list of treatments in chronological order in the “Flow Chart” (drop down boxes) treatment section of the ePCR. This should include any response to the treatments administered. This should include any treatment completed Prior To Arrival (PTA) (e.g., BLS or ALS First Responders, etc.). Treatment should not be documented in the narrative section of the ePCR, but rather in the “Flow Chart” (drop down boxes) treatment section of the ePCR. j. For patients with extremity injury, neurovascular status must be noted before and after immobilization. k. For patients with spinal motion restriction, document motor function before and after motion restriction. l. For IV administration or saline lock placement, the catheter size, site, number of attempts, type of fluid, and flow rate. m. Cardiac monitor strip(s) shall be documented and attached to the PCR for all patients placed on the cardiac monitor, which includes the application of a 12-Lead ECG. Any significant rhythm changes should be documented on the PCR. For cardiac arrests, the initial strip(s), ending strip(s), pre and post defibrillation, and pacing attempts, should be attached to the PCR. n. Any requested medical control orders, whether approved or denied, should be documented clearly. o. Any waste of a controlled medication(s) should include the quantity wasted, where wasted and name of the person who witnessed the waste. Only agency approved personnel should be utilized to witness controlled substance waste. p. All personnel information, including signatures. q. ALL crew members are responsible for, and should review, the content of the PCR for accuracy. r. Completing the record includes marking the record “complete” in the EHR system and uploading the record to the EHR server. C. Electronic Health Record (EHR) Availability 1. The timely delivery of a completed EHR to the receiving facility is a high priority. An EHR for Subject: PATIENT DOCUMENTATION Policy Number 540 Page 5 of 5 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE each transported patient must be left with receiving facility staff prior to clearing the receiving facility. 2. Transporting agencies shall leave a partially completed or preliminary EHR, marked as such, with receiving facility staff if an EHR cannot be completed prior to clearing the receiving facility. If the EHR cannot be completed and a copy left with receiving facility staff before departing the facility, the narrative section of the call report should explain the delay. 3. Non-transporting agencies that have turned over patient care to transporting personnel may send a partially completed or preliminary EHR, marked as such, with the patient. Nontransporting agencies are not required to transmit EHRs to receiving facilities. 4. All EHRs shall be completed, delivered to the receiving facility as applicable and posted to the EHR server at the end of the assigned shift or within twenty-four (24) hours of patient contact. D. The EHR shall be completed and distributed in accordance with this policy. E. Once the EHR is completed and posted, the EHR may not be modified for any reason. Corrections or additions should be in the form of an addendum to the EHR. F. If a paper EHR is used, or a change is made on a hard copy of an automated EHR, documentation errors shall be lined through (e.g., Like this), and the correction shall have the patient attendant’s initials beside it. G. Any changes made to an electronic EHR shall have documentation of those changes retained in the EHR record database. V. ELECTRONIC SYSTEM FAILURE A. Back-up systems to provide for paper EHR documentation must be in place for use should an electronic documentation system fail. Electronic documentation system failure is NOT an exception for providing the required EHR documentation. B. Merced County EMS Agency shall be notified of downtime or transmission difficulties lasting more than twenty-four (24) hours for all electronic EHR system outages. VI. MULTI-CASUALTY (MCI) INCIDENTS A. Electronic Health Record(s) shall be completed for all patients in an MCI unless requirements have been shifted to documentation on triage tags per MCI plan directives. B. In incidents with large numbers of persons refusing treatment or transport, efforts should be made to document as much information as possible. For persons not meeting patient criteria, a Release at Scene Log may be completed and attached to an EHR for the incident.

Policy Number 540 (Patient Documentation), outlining the required patient information, ePCR/EHR standards, and specific documentation procedures for all EMS contacts and situations (including MCI), has now been appended and is clearly separated in your 500 series protocol section.
