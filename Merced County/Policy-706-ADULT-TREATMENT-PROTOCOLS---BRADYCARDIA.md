# EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY POLICY NUMBER 706 A Division of the Merced County Department of Public Health SUBJECT: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - BRADYCARDIA Effective Date 01/2025 Authority: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 4, 1797.220 Initial Date: 07/2022 Review Date: 01/2027 PAGE 1 of 2 Signatures on File Approved By: Tim Williams Ajinder Singh, MD EMS Administrator EMS Medical Director STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE I. DEFINITION Symptomatic bradycardia is defined by all the following: • Heart rate below 50/beats per minute • Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) below 90 mmHg • Associated signs and symptoms – Patient must demonstrate one or more of the following:  ALOC,  signs of shock,  chest pain,  acute pulmonary edema,  syncope,  extreme weakness NOTE: The following medications may cause symptomatic bradycardia, beta blocker, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, organophosphates, and amiodarone II. BLS TREATMENT OXYGEN As appropriate, goal is to maintain SpO2 at least 94%, assist ventilations as necessary. VITALS Assess vital signs. BLOOD SUGAR For patients who have ALOC, treat low blood sugar per EMS Policy \#724 CHECK Adult Treatment Protocols - Altered Level of Consciences (ALOC) or Syncope. III. ALS TREATMENT BLS Follow BLS Procedures if Applicable. MONITOR Treat rhythm as appropriate. 12-LEAD ECG Apply 12-Lead ECG on any chest pain of suspected cardiac origin. If indicated, perform a 12-Lead ECG within 10 minutes of patient contact. Subject: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - BRADYCARDIA Policy Number 706 Page 2 of 2 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE If the 12-Lead ECG reads STEMI or Acute MI or an equivalent; transmit the 12-Lead ECG to appropriate STEMI Receiving Center. VASCULAR ACCESS IV/IO rate as appropriate, if patient has a SBP < than 90 mmHg, administer 250 ml fluid boluses to SBP > than 90 mmHg. Reassess patient after each bolus assessing for signs of fluid overload. CAPNOGRAPHY Utilize waveform capnography; EtCO2 readings of 25 mmHg or less are suggestive of poor organ perfusion. ATROPINE Administer 0.5 mg IV/IO may repeat every 3-5 minutes to a maximum total dose of 3 mg. Atropine should not be used for patients in wide complex bradycardias or 2nd or 3rd degree heart blocks. If there is no improvement in the patient’s condition, consider transcutaneous pacing. TRANSCUTANEOUS For symptomatic patients with 2nd or 3rd degree heart blocks or wide complex PACING (TCP): bradycardias, utilize TCP over Atropine. Initial TCP settings – do not delay TCP if patient is severely symptomatic or difficulty establishing IV/IO access. • Set rate at 80 beats/minute, • Initiate TCP and increase current in 10 mA increments until mechanical capture with pulses are noted • Once mechanical capture is confirmed, adjust current output up to 5-10 mA • Patients that need sedation or pain control to tolerate TCP, so consider using one of the following:  Sedition • Midazolam 2-5 mg IV/IO • May repeat once after five (5) minutes  Pain Management • Morphine 2-5 mg IV/IO or • Fentanyl 25 to 50 mcg IV/IO • May repeat once after five (5) minutes  Fentanyl or Morphine is preferred for patients with chest pain or suspected STEMI’s IV. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND PRIORITIES If the patients’ condition does not improve consider using Push Dose Epinephrine – 10 mcg (1 ml) slow IV push. 1. USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN USING PUSH DOSE EPINEPHERINE PUSH DOSE EPINEPHRINE SOLUTION MIXING INSTRUCTIONS • Take Epinephrine 1:10,000 concentration (1 mg/10 ml) and waste 9 ml of Epinephrine • In same syringe, draw 9 ml of saline from the patient’s IV bag and shake well • Mixture now provides 10 ml of Epinephrine at 10mcg/ml (0.01 mg/ml) concentration • Label syringe Epinephrine 10 mcg/ml
