DEFINITION Known or suspected drug overdose, poisoning, or accidental ingestion. Common symptoms include weakness/dizziness, mild confusion, syncope, unconsciousness, bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmias/widening QRS and seizures. Beta Blockers - Metoprolol/Lopressor/Toprol, Labetalol/Esmolol, Carvedilol/Coreg, Atenolol/Tenormin (amongst others) Calcium Channel Blockers - Norvasc/Amlodipine, Diltiazem/Cardizem, Nifedipine/Procardia, Verapamil/Calan (amongst others) Cyclic Antidepressants - Amitriptyline, Doxepin, Imipramine, Nortriptyline, Trimipramine (amongst others) II. BLS TREATMENT OXYGEN As appropriate, goal to maintain SpO₂ at least 94%. Assist ventilations as necessary. VITALS Assess vitals. BLOOD SUGAR Test glucose and treat as appropriate. III. ALS TREATMENT MONITOR Treat rhythm as appropriate; CONSIDER PACING for HR LESS than 50 and SBP less than 90 mmHg with signs of shock. IV/IO ACCESS As appropriate; establish two (2) large bore IV/IO access if patient has a SBP LESS than 90 mmHg administer 250 ml fluid boluses to SBP GREATER than 90 mmHg. Reassess patient after each bolus. BETA BLOCKERS FOR SBP LESS than 90mmHg PUSH DOSE 10 mcg (1ml) slow IV push every 1-5 minutes until SBP is GREATER EPINEPHERINE than 90 mmHg. Subject: ADULT TREATMENT PROTOCOLS - MEDICATION POISONINGS Policy Number 736 Page 2 of 2 STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE GLUCAGON 2 mg IV push for SBP LESS than 90 mmHg and patient not responding to previous treatment. CALCIUM CHANNEL FOR SBP LESS than 90 mmHg BLOCKERS CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000mg (100 mg/ml) very slow IV push (1ml/minute) over 10 minutes or SBP GREATER than 90 mmHg PUSH DOSE 10 mcg (1ml) slow IV push every 1-5 minutes until SBP is LESS than 90 EPINEPHERINE mmHg and patient not responding to previous treatment. CYCLIC ANTIDREPRESSANT FOR SBP LESS than 90 mmHg SODIUM BICARBINATE 1 mEq/kg slow IV push for cardiac dysrhythmia or QRS complex wider than 0.10 second. Repeat as necessary. PUSH DOSE 10 mcg (1ml) slow IV push every 1-5 minutes until SBP is LESS than EPINEPHERINE 90 mmHg and patient not responding to previous treatment. MIDAZOLAM 2 mg IV/IO slow IV push. Titrate in 1 mg increments if seizure continues. Maximum dose 5 mg IV/IO. May administer 5mg IN/IM if no IV access available. IV. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND PRIORITIES 1. Administer fluid boluses with caution due to the high incidence of pulmonary edema in tricyclic overdose patients. Most tricyclic overdose seizures are short in duration and may not require the administration midazolam. 2. USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN USING PUSH DOSE EPINEPHERINE PUSH DOSE EPINEPHRINE SOLUTION MIXING INSTRUCTIONS • Take Epinephrine 1:10,000 concentration (1 mg/10 ml) and waste 9 ml of Epinephrine • In same syringe draw 9 ml of saline from the patient’s IV bag and shake well • Mixture now provides 10 ml of Epinephrine at 10mcg/ml (0.01 mg/ml) concentration • Label syringe Epinephrine 10 mcg/ml
