## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Airway Management

Burns associated with respiratory compromise or respiratory stridor warrant aggressive airway control and ventilation if possible. ET Intubation is indicated prior to complete airway occlusion. If an airway occlusion occurs, refer to the airway obstruction protocol.

### 2. Pain Management Considerations

Ketamine should be the first line medication for hypotensive patients or patients at risk of respiratory depression. Fentanyl and Morphine sulfate for pain control is contraindicated in patients with hypoperfusion or respiratory compromise or potential for deterioration of blood pressure or respiratory status. Fentanyl or Morphine sulfate for pain control may be given to patients with respiratory compromise once the airway is secured by ET intubation.

### 3. Hypoperfusion

Hypoperfusion associated with large body surface thermal burns is common but not usually seen in the first twelve hours. If hypoperfusion exists, consider underlying trauma.

### 4. IV Access

Interstitial swelling and circumferential extremity burns may cause problems with infusion of IV fluids. Whenever possible establish an IV in an unaffected or least affected extremity. If no options are available an IV may be established in a burned extremity though the IV bag may need to be pressurized (blood pump or BP cuff) to maintain IV flow. Use only the amount of pressure needed to maintain flow.

### 5. Chemical Burns

With chemical burns, consider the Hazardous Materials emergency potential and personnel safety, appropriate PPE should be used. Patients that are contaminated with hazardous chemicals must be decontaminated prior to unprotected personnel access or standard means of transport.

### 6. Transport Destination

Burns without red tier trauma may be transported to any designated burn-receiving facility. Burns with red tier trauma should be transported to a trauma center.

### 7. Cooling Burns

Burns to large body surface (<30% TBSA) areas should be cooled initially with cold running tap water for 20 minutes prior to transport and then wrap in dry sterile dressing to prevent hypothermia. EMS personnel shall perform this procedure up to 3 hours after the injury has occurred.

### 8. Ketamine Analgesia Table

| **Contraindications** | **Caution** | **Side Effects** |
|----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Age < 4 years | Likelihood of respiratory depression and undesired pressor effects are increased by too rapid IV administration | Tachycardia |
| GCS 14 or less | | Increased salivation |
| Known or suspected alcohol or drug intoxication | | Laryngospasm occurs mostly at higher doses |
| Known or suspected pregnancy | | Nausea/Vomiting |
