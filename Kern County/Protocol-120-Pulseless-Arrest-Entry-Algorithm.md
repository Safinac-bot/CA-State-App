## TREATMENT PROTOCOL

| **Adults** | **Pediatrics (13 years and under)** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** | **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** |
| • If the patient is unconscious and pulseless begin High-Performance CPR<br>• Request EMS and Fire response<br>• Begin cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths.<br>• Use an AED as soon as it is available. Attach AED, follow AED prompts, if AED indicates "shock advised," give 30 compressions and shock as indicated by device.<br>• Resume High-Performance CPR immediately post shock<br>• Closely monitor patient for changes | • If the patient is unconscious and pulseless begin High-Performance CPR<br>• Request EMS and Fire response<br>• 1 Rescuer: Begin cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths. (Use 15:2 ratio if second rescuer arrives.)<br>• Use an AED as soon as it is available. Attach AED, follow AED prompts, if AED indicates "shock advised," give 30 compressions and shock as indicated by device if patient is over 1 year of age<br>• Resume High-Performance CPR immediately post shock<br>• Closely monitor patient for changes |
| **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** | **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** |
| • Begin/Continue High-Performance CPR if no signs of obvious death<br>• Give Oxygen and ventilate<br>• Attach AED, follow AED prompts, if AED indicates "shock advised," give compressions as device is charging and shock as indicated by device.<br>• Minimize interruptions in High-Performance CPR<br>• Ensure high quality compressions are being delivered<br>• If no change after 30 minutes, consider termination of efforts per determination of death policy | • Begin/Continue High-Performance CPR if no signs of obvious death<br>• Give Oxygen and ventilate<br>• Attach AED, follow AED prompts, if AED indicates "shock advised," give compressions as device is charging and shock as indicated by device if patient is over 1 year of age.<br>• Minimize interruptions in High-Performance CPR<br>• Ensure high quality compressions are being delivered<br>• Request ALS rendezvous. Initiate transport if ALS ETA is greater than 10 min |
| **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** | **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** |
| • Attach Monitor/Defibrillator<br>• Enter V-Fib/Pulseless V-Tach Protocol (126) if shockable rhythm<br>• Enter Asystole/PEA Protocol (104) if non-shockable rhythm<br>• If there is no change after 30 minutes, consider termination of efforts<br>• Do not pause compressions to perform ALS procedures.<br>• Consider placement of nasogastric tube for gastric distension | • Attach Monitor/Defibrillator<br>• Enter V-Fib/Pulseless V-Tach Protocol (126) if shockable rhythm<br>• Enter Asystole/PEA Protocol (104) if non-shockable rhythm<br>• Consider placement of nasogastric tube for gastric distension |

**IMPORTANT:** For patients < 18 years begin transport after 10 minutes of High-Performance CPR or if ROSC is achieved

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

**Consider H's and T's when applicable.**

### 1. High-Performance CPR Guidelines

High-Performance CPR increases sudden cardiac arrest survival rates significantly. To implement High-Performance CPR, ensure:

- **Compression rate:** 100-120 CPM with a depth of 2 inches for adults
- **Metronome:** Shall be used and set at 105-115
- **Compression to ventilation ratio:** 30:2 or 10:1 continual compression to ventilation rate are both acceptable depending upon agency policy
- **Ventilations:** Should be performed to achieve chest rise only (approximately 300-400 mL). Utilize the 3-finger method or ventilate from the back of the BVM
- **Defibrillators:** Should be pre-charged prior to rhythm/pulse checks
- **Pauses in compressions:** Should be for AED analysis periods only. Give 30 compressions prior to shock delivery
- **CPR continuity:** CPR should not be stopped to perform ALS interventions such as IV/IO or Intubation
- **Compressor rotation:** Compressors should be rotated every 2 minutes as personnel are available
- **Transitions:** Transitions in compressors should be during pulse checks and take < 3 seconds
- **Full chest recoil:** Full chest recoil between each compression is crucial to provide perfusion to the myocardium

### 2. ALS Waveform Capnography

ALS apply waveform capnography to BVM or airway device immediately after ventilations are initiated.

### 3. BLS Capnography

BLS apply colorimetric or waveform capnography to BVM airway device immediately after ventilations are initiated (Waveform Capnography preferred).

### 4. Additional Considerations

Consider Naloxone, blood glucose analysis and Dextrose (if hypoglycemic) in all unresponsive patients including cardiopulmonary arrest. When possible, blood glucose analysis is indicated prior to administration of 10% Dextrose.
