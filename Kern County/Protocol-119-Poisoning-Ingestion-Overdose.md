| **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** | **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** |
| • Support ABC's<br>• Request Fire/EMS<br>• Consider Naloxone if signs of opiate overdose with respiratory depression, 1 mg per nare.<br>• If using 4mg preload intranasal may use this as initial dose. | • Support ABC's<br>• Request Fire/EMS<br>• Consider Naloxone if signs of opiate overdose with respiratory depression, If using 4mg preload intranasal may use this as initial dose. |

| • In HAZ-MAT situations, prevent responder contamination. If is substance is powder brush off first then flush with water, remove clothing, decontaminate.<br>• Administer oxygen only if SpO2 <94% or if in respiratory distress<br>• Support ABC'S<br>• If suspected opiate overdose with respiratory depression administer Naloxone: Adult 2 mg intramuscular or intranasal MAX dose, 1 mg per nare.<br>• Prepare for rapid transport or ALS rendezvous. | • In HAZ-MAT situations, prevent responder contamination. If is substance is powder brush off first then flush with water, remove clothing, decontaminate.<br>• Administer oxygen SpO2 <94% or if in respiratory distress<br>• Support ABC'S<br>• If suspected opiate overdose with respiratory depression administer Naloxone intramuscular or intranasal for children < 1 year give 0.5 mg. Children 1-7 years give 1 mg, for children > 8 give 2 mg.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ If given intranasal split dose between nares.<br>• Prepare for rapid transport or ALS rendezvous. |
| **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** | **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** |
| • If patient has altered mentation, rule out other treatable causes.<br>• If oral ingestion and patient is oriented with patent airway and ingestion was not a caustic substance administer Activated Charcoal 50 grams PO.<br>• If suspected opiate overdose with respiratory depression administer Naloxone 0.4-2 mg IV/IM/IN/IO<br>• If suspected opioid withdrawals, immediately use "COWS" score to determine if patient meets criteria to receive buprenorphine. Patients must have a score of 6 or higher. If criteria met initiate a Tele911 consult to review indications and arrange for follow up, administer 16mg SL after Tele911 consult has been initiated. May administer a 2nd dose of 8mg SL if symptoms persist or worsen after 10 minutes.<br>• If symptomatic tricyclic antidepressant overdose, consider Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV<br>• If symptomatic calcium channel blocker overdose, consider Calcium Chloride 1 gram slow IV/IO<br>• If symptomatic beta blocker overdose, consider Glucagon 2 mg IV/IO<br>• If dystonic reaction to phenothiazines, administer Diphenhydramine 50 mg slow IVP or IM<br>• If symptomatic organophosphate poisoning, administer Atropine 2 mg IV every 5 minutes as needed. | • If patient has altered mentation, rule out other treatable causes.<br>• If oral ingestion and patients are oriented with patent airway and ingestion was not a caustic substance administer Activated Charcoal 25 grams PO.<br>• If suspected opiate overdose with respiratory depression, administer Naloxone, if 5 years old or older 0.4-2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN. If <5 years 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO/IM/IN<br>• If symptomatic tricyclic antidepressant overdose, consider Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV<br>• If symptomatic calcium channel blocker overdose, consider Calcium Chloride 20 mg/kg slow IV/IO<br>• If symptomatic beta blocker overdose, consider Glucagon 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO<br>• If dystonic reaction to phenothiazines administer Diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg slow IV/IM<br>• If symptomatic organophosphate poisoning administer Atropine 0.05-0.1mg/kg IV/IM every 5 minutes as needed |

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Ingestions - History Collection

Obtain accurate history:
- Name of product or substance
- Quantity ingested
- Time of ingestion
- Pertinent medical history
- Pill bottles/description of pills

### 2. HAZ-MAT - Cholinergic Crisis

Cholinergic crisis:
- Initially patients may experience tachycardia
- Bradycardia, salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, sweating, twitching, abdominal cramps, vomiting, pinpoint pupils, smell of pesticides, hypoxia, seizure, coma
- Obtain name of product or substance
- Determine time of exposure
- Obtain route of exposure (i.e. inhalation, absorption, etc.)

### 3. Primary Treatment Goal

The primary goal in the treatment of oral ingestion is to prevent the absorption of the toxic substance by the small intestine.

### 4. Activated Charcoal Administration

Activated charcoal should not be used if the toxin is a strong acid, strong alkali, or ethanol. Activated charcoal should not be used if a specific antidote exists. Activated charcoal is given P.O. only, no N.G. tube administration shall be attempted.

### 5. Caustic Ingestions

In caustic ingestions, do not give anything by mouth.

### 6. Insecticides (Organophosphates, Carbonates)

Decontaminate as soon as possible; avoid contamination of prehospital personnel; assess for **SLUDGE** (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Diaphoresis/Diarrhea, Gastric Hypermotility, and Emesis/Eye [small pupils and/or blurry vision]). Administer Atropine 2.0mg IVP slowly. If there is no tachycardia or pupil dilation, may give repeat dose every 5 minutes as needed. Minimum pediatric dose 0.1mg.

### 7. Tricyclic Ingestion

Continued assessment of patients with tricyclic ingestions is very important. These patients can deteriorate rapidly. In the presence of life-threatening dysrhythmia hyperventilate; administer 1mEq/kg Sodium Bicarbonate. Refer to Seizure Activity (122) or Shock/Hypoperfusion Protocol (125) as needed.

### 8. Calcium Channel Blockers

If bradycardic and/or hypotensive, consider administration 1 gram of Calcium Chloride slow IV push. Enter appropriate protocol as needed.

### 9. Beta Blockers

If bradycardic and/or hypotensive, consider administration 2mg of Glucagon. Enter the appropriate protocol as needed.

### 10. Dystonic Reactions

Dystonic reactions to phenothiazine's or butyrophenone (Haldol) should be treated with 50 mg Diphenhydramine slow IV push preferred, may give IM. Signs and symptoms include fixed, deviated gaze to one side of the body, painful spasm of trunk or extremity muscles, and difficulty speaking. Enter the appropriate protocol as needed.

### 11. Buprenorphine Administration

Buprenorphine is FDA-approved for managing opioid dependence or opioid withdrawals with a **Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS)** score of 6 or higher.

### 12. Buprenorphine Contraindications

Do not administer buprenorphine if the following contraindications are present:
- Patient is under 16 years of age
- Any methadone use within the last 10 days
- Altered mental status
- Sepsis
- Current intoxication or recent use of benzodiazepine
- COWS score of less than 7

**Telehealth consultation is required** prior to buprenorphine administration and Naloxone leave behind (documentation requirement) shall be dispensed to all patients receiving buprenorphine. To review indications and arrange for follow up.

### 13. Naloxone Administration Guidelines

Naloxone is intended to reverse respiratory depression associated with narcotic use. Naloxone may be withheld if respiratory depression is not present. The goal is to titrate Naloxone to improve respiratory distress but not precipitate severe withdrawals.

- **ALS** – Generally a full 2mg IV dose, should not be given as an immediate bolus. Naloxone may be repeated as needed after the first dose.
- **BLS** – Does not repeat intranasal dose after 1ml of volume per nare. IM doses may be repeated.
- **Public Safety-First Aid** – If using 4mg preload intranasal may use this as initial dose.
