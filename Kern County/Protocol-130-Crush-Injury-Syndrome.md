## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic Only

### Adults

**Initial Interventions:**
- Establish IV/IO access
- Initiate cardiac monitoring
- If unable to establish vascular access while entrapped, place tourniquet PRIOR to extrication

**If Patient is at Risk for Crush Injury Syndrome OR Evidence of Hyperkalemia:**
*(Peaked T-waves in multiple leads, absent p-waves, and/or widened QRS complex)*

**Administer the following medications:**

1. **Calcium Chloride:** 20 mg/kg slow IV/IO push
   - Repeat × 1 for persistent ECG abnormalities

2. **Sodium Bicarbonate:** 1 mEq/kg slow IV/IO push
   - Repeat × 1 for persistent ECG abnormalities

3. **Albuterol:** 5 mg via nebulizer
   - Repeat continuously until hospital arrival

4. **Normal Saline:** 20 mL/kg IV/IO rapid prior to release of compressive force
   - May repeat × 1 for a total of 40 mL/kg IV/IO
   - Maximum prior to Base contact: 2 L

**Additional Management:**
- For pain management: Refer to Protocol 117 (Pain Control/Fever)
- For nausea or vomiting: Administer Ondansetron 4 mg

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)

**Initial Interventions:**
- Establish IV/IO access
- Initiate cardiac monitoring
- If unable to establish vascular access while entrapped, place tourniquet PRIOR to extrication

**If Patient is at Risk for Crush Injury Syndrome OR Evidence of Hyperkalemia:**
*(Peaked T-waves in multiple leads, absent p-waves, and/or widened QRS complex)*

**Administer the following medications:**

1. **Calcium Chloride:** 20 mg/kg slow IV/IO push
   - Repeat × 1 for persistent ECG abnormalities

2. **Sodium Bicarbonate:** 1 mEq/kg slow IV/IO push
   - Repeat × 1 for persistent ECG abnormalities

3. **Albuterol:** 5 mg via nebulizer

## Base Hospital Contact Required

### Adults
- Obtain order for additional Normal Saline 20 mL/kg IV/IO if persistent entrapment
- For persistent ECG abnormalities, obtain order for additional medications

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Obtain order for additional Normal Saline 20 mL/kg IV/IO if persistent entrapment
- For persistent ECG abnormalities, obtain order for additional medications

## Special Considerations

### 1. Definition of Crush Syndrome
Crush syndrome is a systemic illness characterized by dysrhythmia and shock. It results from toxins released from crushed muscle tissue into the blood stream.

**Patients are at risk for crush syndrome if they have ALL of the following:**
1. Circumferential compression causing crush injury; **AND**
2. Involvement of a large muscle group (lower extremity including the thigh(s) and/or pelvic girdle or upper extremity including the pectoral girdle); **AND**
3. Entrapment for at least 1 hour

**Note:** The risk of crush syndrome increases with the amount of muscle involved and the duration of the entrapment.

### 2. Crush Injury WITHOUT Risk of Crush Syndrome
- Release compression and extricate patient
- Monitor cardiac rhythm for signs of hyperkalemia

### 3. Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR) and Backboards
- A backboard is **not required** for spinal motion restriction (SMR) and may cause harm as well as increased pain
- Patients should **not be transported on a backboard** for the purpose of SMR
- If a backboard is used for extrication, patients who are alert should then be logrolled onto the gurney prior to transport
- The backboard may be used during patient transport for:
  - Splinting of multiple simultaneous extremity fractures
  - Assisting with maneuvering the unconscious patient
- **In all cases, the backboard should be removed immediately if causing respiratory compromise**

### 4. Vascular Access for Crush Injury Patients
Patients with crush injury require large volumes of fluid resuscitation. Patients with prolonged entrapment will require maintenance fluids.

**IO access should be considered when attempts at IV access are not successful if:**
1. Prolonged entrapment is likely (> 30 minutes); **and/or**
2. There are signs of hyperkalemia; **and/or**
3. There is risk of crush syndrome requiring medication administration

### 5. Medication Administration
- **Flush the IV line with normal saline after each medication**
- **Administration of Calcium and Bicarbonate together will cause precipitation of the medication**

### 6. Albuterol Administration in Pediatrics
- Higher doses of albuterol are required to treat hyperkalemia
- Consider blow-by to avoid agitation in pediatric patients if a mask cannot be tolerated (e.g., infants and toddlers)

### 7. Medication Duration of Action
- The duration of the action of the medications is approximately 30 minutes
- Contact Base to discuss re-dosing the medications if:
  - Persistent signs of hyperkalemia; **OR**
  - If the patient will not arrive at the hospital within 30 minutes

### 8. Tourniquet Placement Prior to Extrication
Tourniquet placement PRIOR to extrication is a **last resort** for patients who are at risk for crush syndrome in whom:
- Vascular access cannot be established; **OR**
- When transport time is anticipated to be > 30 minutes

**Important considerations:**
- The tourniquet must **completely occlude venous and arterial flow** in order to protect the patient from crush syndrome
- Establish vascular access and cardiac monitoring immediately after extrication
- Be prepared to treat symptoms of crush syndrome upon extrication of the patient
- **Calcium stabilizes the cardiac muscle and should be administered first**

### 9. Medication Timing
These medications should be administered **prior to release of the compressive force** to prevent complications from the cellular toxins that enter the circulation.

### 10. Hypothermia Risk in Pediatrics
Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to:
- Large surface area to body mass ratio
- Reduced ability to shiver
- Limited body fat
