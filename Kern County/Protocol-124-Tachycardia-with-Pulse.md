## 124 TACHYCARDIA WITH PULSE

## Adults | Pediatrics (13 years and under)

### Public Safety First Aid Procedures

**Adult:**
- Request Fire/ALS

**Pediatrics:**
- Request Fire/ALS

---

### BLS Procedures:

**Adult:**
- Assess ABC's
- Give oxygen to titrate SpO2 94-99% or if in respiratory distress
- Hand off to ALS as needed

**Pediatrics:**
- Assess ABC's
- Give oxygen to titrate SpO2 94-99% or if in respiratory distress
- Hand off to ALS as needed

---

### ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact:

**Adult:**
- Acquire 12-lead
- Establish IV/IO access
- Identify and treat reversible causes
- **Unstable Tachycardia:** PERFORM IMMEDIATE SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION, consider sedation but do not delay synchronized cardioversion. See Energy Doses for Cardioversion Chart.
- **SVT Stable narrow QRS <0.12 SEC >150 With Regular Pulse:**
  - Attempt Vagal Maneuvers, if no change
  - Give Adenosine 6 mg Rapid IVP if no change
  - Repeat Adenosine at 12 mg rapid IVP X 2 as needed
- **Atrial Fibrillation:** Stable Irregular Narrow QRS <0.12 SEC >150 beats per minute administer Magnesium 2-4 grams Slow IV over 15 minutes. Do not attempt Valsalva or adenosine administration to AFIB with RVR.
- **Stable Wide QRS >0.12 SEC. with regular rate:**
  - Give Lidocaine 1 – 1.5 mg/kg IV/IO, may repeat Lidocaine 0.5 – 0.75 mg/kg every 5 – 10 minutes to MAX dose of 3 mg
- **Stable Wide QRS >0.12 SEC with irregular rate:**
  - Consider Magnesium Sulfate 1-2 grams diluted in 100 mL N/S over 5-10 minutes for TORSADES DE POINTES

**Pediatrics:**
- Acquire 12 lead
- Establish IV/IO access
- Identify and treat reversible causes
- **Unstable Wide QRS >0.08 SEC: possible VT?**
  - Synchronized cardioversion consider sedation but do not delay synchronized cardioversion. See Energy Doses for Cardioversion Chart.
- **Narrow regular rhythm QRS <0.08 SEC:**
  - If sinus tachycardia, identify and treat underlying causes.
- **If SVT:**
  - Consider vagal maneuvers, if no delay and If IV access immediately available give Adenosine 0.1 mg/kg rapid IVP, MAX of 6 mg. May repeat X 2 with 0.2 mg/kg rapid IVP MAX of 12 mg
- **If IV access delayed or no change with Adenosine:**
  - Synchronized Cardioversion consider sedation but do not delay cardioversion. See Energy Doses for Cardioversion Chart.
- **If irregular narrow complex rhythm QRS <0.08 SEC:**
  - Transport to appropriate facility, base for direction
- **Stable Wide QRS >0.08SEC: Possible VT?**
  - Monitor and transport be ready for patient to decompensate.
- **Stable Wide QRS with an irregular rate:**
  - Consider Magnesium Sulfate 25mg/kg IV/IO drip OR IVP, over 5-10 minutes. MAX 2 grams for TORSADES DE POINTES

## Base Hospital Contact Required

**Adult:**
- (None listed prior to base contact)

**Pediatrics:**
- Make base contact for Lidocaine for Tachycardia that fails to respond to cardioversion, IV/IO: 1 mg/kg. If rhythm persists, repeat dose in 10 minutes.

## Special Considerations

1. The primary decision point for tachycardia is the adequacy of perfusion. If the patient has inadequate perfusion, prepare for immediate synchronized cardioversion. Adenosine may be given if IV is already established, but cardioversion should not be delayed by obtaining IV access. Provide sedation to a conscious patient, if possible, but do not delay cardioversion if the patient is unstable.

2. Serious signs and symptoms are unlikely to be present with rate < 150 bpm. Sinus Tachycardia is caused by external influences on the heart, such as fever, blood loss, stress, or as compensation for hypoperfusion. If you attempt to reduce the heart rate for a person in compensatory tachycardia the cardiac output will fall, and the patient will likely deteriorate. The goal of care is to identify and treat the underlying cause.
   - **Sinus tachycardia with signs of infection:** Consider sepsis and give fluid bolus 10mL/kg may repeat as needed.

3. It may be difficult to distinguish between supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. Most wide complex tachycardia's are ventricular in origin; therefore, if a patient has wide complex tachycardia and is unstable, assume it is VT until proven otherwise.

4. Low energy shocks should always be delivered as synchronized shocks. Low energy unsynchronized shocks (defibrillation) are likely to induce VF.

5. Tachycardia may be a compensatory response to a medical issue, such as stress or fever or it may be of cardiac origin that may lead to shock and deterioration into cardiac arrest. The key to proper treatment of tachycardia is to differentiate whether the tachycardia is the primary cause of the patient's symptoms, or if the tachycardia is a compensatory response to a separate medical issue.

6. Common causes of sinus tachycardia include hypoxia, hypovolemia, fever, metabolic stress, injury, pain, anxiety, toxins, and anemia.

7. Supraventricular tachycardia often appears abruptly and may be intermittent.

## Sinus Tachycardia vs Supraventricular Tachycardia

| Characteristic | Sinus Tachycardia | Supraventricular Tachycardia |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **History** | Gradual onset with compatible history (ex: fever, pain, dehydration) | Abrupt onset or termination. Possible complaint of palpitations or CHF symptoms |
| **Physical Exam** | Signs of underlying cause (ex: fever, hypovolemia, anemia) | No attributable cause. Signs of CHF (ex: rales, edema) |
| **Heart Rate** | Infant: < 220/min<br>Child: < 180/min<br>Variability in HR in response to changes in activity/stimulation, P waves present/normal | Infant: > 220/min<br>Child: > 180/min<br>Minimal variability in HR with changes in activity/stimulation, P waves absent/abnormal |
