## Public Safety First Aid Procedures

### Intranasal - Adults
- Ensure syringe, nasal atomizer and medication are intact and serviceable, check expiration date
- If not pre-assembled, attach syringe to atomizer
- Verify nasal passages are clear
- Administer medication to a max of 1 mL per nare

### Intranasal - Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Ensure syringe, nasal atomizer and medication are intact and serviceable, check expiration date
- If not pre-assembled, attach syringe to atomizer
- Verify nasal passages are clear
- Administer medication to a max of 1 mL per nare

## BLS Procedures

### Intranasal - Adults
- Ensure syringe, nasal atomizer and medication are intact and serviceable, check expiration date
- If not pre-assembled, attach syringe to atomizer
- Verify nasal passages are clear
- Administer medication to a max of 1 mL per nare
- **EMT may not repeat intranasal dose after 1 mL of volume per nare**

### Intranasal - Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Ensure syringe, nasal atomizer and medication are intact and serviceable, check expiration date
- If not pre-assembled, attach syringe to atomizer
- Verify nasal passages are clear
- Administer medication to a max of 1 mL per nare
- **EMT may not repeat intranasal dose after 1 mL of volume per nare**

## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic Only

### INTEROSSEOUS ACCESS - ADULTS

#### Proximal Tibia
1. Palpate the tibial tuberosity
2. Locate insertion site approximately 2-3 cm medially at the broad flat aspect of the tibia
3. Insert intraosseous needle into the broad flat anterio-medial surface of the tibia
4. Aspirate to confirm placement
5. Secure in place

**Pain Management for IO Infusion:**
- For patients that respond to painful stimuli, consider slow administration of **Lidocaine 2% 40 mg slow IO**, prior to infusing fluids for pain associated with IO infusion
- The initial bolus of lidocaine should be given **prior to administration of the 10 mL saline flush**
- Allow the lidocaine to work for **30 to 60 seconds** before administering fluids

#### Proximal Humerus
1. Place the hand over the abdomen with the arm tight against the body to landmark on the anterior shoulder
2. Palpate the greater tubercle by letting it sink into the palm of your hand
3. Insert needle at **45-degree angle, towards opposite hip**
4. If the patient is unable to place arm across abdomen, you may adduct and internally rotate the arm with thumb facing down. This will also expose site for access
5. **Do not raise arm above 45-degree angle** - this will cause risk of needle dislodgement
6. Aspirate to confirm placement

### INTEROSSEOUS ACCESS - PEDIATRICS (13 years and under)

#### Proximal Tibia IO Site
- Refer to Adult Protocol for landmarking
- For patients that respond to painful stimuli, consider slow administration of **Lidocaine 2% 0.5 mg/kg slow IO, max of 40 mg** prior to infusing fluids for pain associated with IO infusion
- The initial bolus of lidocaine should be given **prior to administration of the 10 mL saline flush**
- Allow the lidocaine to work for **30 to 60 seconds** before administering fluids

#### Distal Femur
1. Ensure the leg is stretched out with the foot pointing straight up and the knee does not bend
2. Palpate the patella
3. Insert intraosseous needle approximately 1 to 2 cm (1-2 finger breadths) proximal to the patella and approximately 1 to 2 cm medial to the midline
4. Insert needle at a **90-degree angle to the bone**

### INTRAVENOUS ACCESS

#### Adults
- A saline lock may be used for blood draw or when a patient requires intravenous access but does not require continuous infusion of an intravenous solution
- **A saline lock alone may NOT be used for patients at risk of hypoperfusion** (i.e. cardiac arrest, burn, or signs of physiological shock)

#### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- A saline lock may be used for blood draw or when a patient requires intravenous access but does not require continuous infusion of an intravenous solution
- **A saline lock alone may NOT be used for patients at risk of hypoperfusion** (i.e. cardiac arrest, burn, or signs of physiological shock)

---

## Base Hospital Contact Required

### Adults
*(No specific base hospital contact requirements listed)*

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
*(No specific base hospital contact requirements listed)*

---

## Special Considerations

### Anatomical Reference Diagrams

**Three IO Access Sites:**
- **Proximal Tibia**
- **Proximal Humerus**
- **Distal Femur**

---

### 1. Indications for IO Access

#### A. Cardiac Arrest

#### B. Critical Patients Where Rapid Vascular Access is Unavailable by Other Means

**In the following conditions:**
- Multisystem trauma with severe hypovolemia
- Severe dehydration with vascular collapse and/or loss of consciousness
- Respiratory failure or respiratory arrest
- Patient is unstable

---

### 2. Contraindications for IO Access

- Fracture is proximal to the proposed intraosseous site
- History of osteogenesis imperfecta
- Current or recent infection at proposed intraosseous site
- Previous intraosseous insertion at the identified site within 24 hours
- Joint replacement at or above the selected intraosseous site
- Excessive tissue (severe obesity) and/or absence of adequate anatomical landmarks
- **Distal femur IO access SHALL NOT be obtained on CONSCIOUS patients**
