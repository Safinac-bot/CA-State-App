## TREATMENT PROTOCOL

### Neonate (20 weeks gestation or less than 28 days old)

#### Public Safety First Aid Procedures: only

- Dry newborn and keep warm/Stimulate by drying vigorously including head and back
- Do not cut the cord await Fire/EMS arrival
- If a child is limp, silent and cyanotic begin CPR

#### BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here

- Dry newborn and keep warm/Stimulate by drying vigorously including head and back
- Clamp and cut cord when no longer pulsatile for approximately 1 minute
- Assess respiratory status/pulse oximetry
- **Mild distress** = Administer oxygen or blended air/oxygen via blow by mask
- **Severe distress** = Agonal/gasping/absent respirations: Assist respirations with BVM and 100% oxygen at a rate of 40-60 per minute
- Evaluate Heart rate via auscultation or at umbilical cord
- **Heart rate less than 60** = Ventilate for 30 seconds and start compressions at a rate of 120/min reassess heart rate after 30 seconds
- **Heart rate 60-100** = ventilate for 30 seconds reassess and re-enter as heart rate changes

#### ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only

- Attach monitor/EtCO2
- If the heart rate still <60bpm establish IV/IO and administer Epinephrine drip 0.1-1 mcg/kg/min not to exceed adult dose, repeat as needed. Start at a higher dose and titrate down.
- Assess blood glucose via heel stick if <40mg/dL administer dextrose 10% 5 mL/kg IV/IO rapid IV bolus
- If there is no improvement after 30 seconds, consider supraglottic airway/ reassess and re-enter as heart rate changes
- Consider fluid bolus if blood loss is suspected, 10 mL/kg may repeat once

#### Base Hospital Contact Required

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Initiation Criteria

Neonatal resuscitation should be initiated on all premature infants who are reported to be over 20 weeks gestation or less than 28 days old. If over 28 days old refer to appropriate pediatric protocol. If unknown length of gestation, initiate neonatal resuscitation.

### 2. Hypothermia Prevention

Low birth weight and premature infants are likely to become hypothermic despite traditional warming techniques. Extra care should be taken to avoid heat loss to the infant during resuscitation.

### 3. Bradycardia and Cardiac Arrest

Hypoxia is the most common cause of bradycardia and cardiac arrest in neonates. This can be prevented by prompt suctioning and assisted ventilation. The primary measure of adequate ventilation is prompt improvement in heart rate.

### 4. Oxygen Saturation Management

Studies have shown that insufficient or excessive oxygenation of neonates may be harmful. Optimal oxygen saturation levels may not be achieved until 10 minutes following birth. Pulse oximeters should be attached to a preductal location (i.e. right upper extremity, usually the wrist or medial surface of the palm). Studies have discovered that if the pulse oximeter is applied to the neonate and connected before it is turned on, the accuracy of the reading is increased. Initial resuscitation attempts on neonates with mild distress should include room air, or a mixture to achieve oxygen saturation levels titrated to the chart below:

#### Targeted Preductal SpO2 After Birth

| Time After Birth | Target SpO2 |
|------------------|-------------|
| 1 min | 60-65% |
| 2 min | 65-70% |
| 3 min | 70-75% |
| 4 min | 75-80% |
| 5 min | 80-85% |
| 10 min | 85-95% |

### 5. Transport Timing

Initiate transport for an infant in distress after 10 minutes of High-Performance CPR or if ROSC is achieved. Priorities should be good CPR followed by rapid transport.

### 6. Medication Dosing

Refer to Handtevy or length-based tape for specific pediatric doses.

### 7. Volume Expansion

Volume expansion should be considered when blood loss is known or suspected (pale skin, poor perfusion, and weak pulse) and the infant's heart rate has not responded adequately to other resuscitative measures. Avoid giving volume expanders rapidly. Rapid infusions of large volumes have been related to intraventricular hemorrhage.

### 8. Naloxone NOT Recommended

Naloxone is not recommended as part of the initial resuscitation for newborns with respiratory depression. The focus needs to remain on effective ventilation and airway support for the persistently apneic newborn.
