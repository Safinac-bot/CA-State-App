## Public Safety First Aid Procedures

### Adults and Pediatric
- Support ABC's
- Administer oxygen as needed
- Request fire/EMS

---

## BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics Start Here

**Initial Management:**
- Support ABC's
- Apply oxygen
- Request ALS or rapid transport to the appropriate facility

**CPAP Eligibility Screening:**

**Is patient:**
- > 8 years old?
- GCS > 10?
- Able to follow commands?
- B/P > 90 systolic?

**Two of the following criteria present:**
- Respiratory rate > 25
- Retractions or accessory muscle use
- SpO2 < 94%
- Abnormal or diminished lung sounds

**If YES, check for contraindications:**
- Agonal respirations or apnea
- Pneumothorax or penetrating chest trauma
- Tracheostomy
- Systolic B/P < 90
- Aspiration risk (vomiting, epistaxis, facial trauma)

**Decision:**
- If there are **no contraindications:** Initiate CPAP
- Otherwise: Enter appropriate protocol

## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic Only

*(No specific ALS interventions listed prior to base hospital contact)*

---

## Base Hospital Contact Required

### For Anxiolytic/Sedation (if needed for CPAP tolerance):

**Adult:**
- Midazolam 5 mg IM **or** 2 mg IV

**Pediatric:**
- Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IM **or** 0.05 mg/kg IV
- Not to exceed adult dose

---

## Special Considerations

### General Precautions:
- Use caution if patient has decreased mentation or is unable to cooperate with procedure
- Recent G.I. bleed or epigastric surgery
- May cause hypotension due to increased intrathoracic pressure
- May cause pneumothorax, gastric distention, corneal drying

### 1. CPAP Training Requirements
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) may be considered if available for emergency medical technicians and paramedics who have met the training requirements for the skill.

### 2. CPAP Definition and Purpose
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a non-invasive mechanically assisted oxygen delivery system designed to decrease work of breathing while allowing time for patients to respond to other medical interventions.

### 3. Clinical Benefits
CPAP has been shown to rapidly improve pulmonary gas exchange, decreasing the need for endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal intubation is associated with a longer length of hospital stay and an increase in morbidity and mortality.

### 4. Mechanism of Action
Continuous airway pressure offers several significant benefits to a patient experiencing respiratory distress:
- The continuous pressure prevents the small airway from collapsing on exhalation, providing an increase in alveolar ventilation
- Additionally, fluid is moved from the airway, back into the vasculature which reduces pulmonary edema

### 5. Age and Size Requirements
- CPAP is approved for use on adults, and children aged eight (8) and older
- The use of CPAP depends on the proper mask fit
- **The size and anatomy of the patient is a more important factor than the age in determining eligibility for CPAP**

### 6. Patient Cooperation and Support
- The administration of CPAP requires patient understanding and cooperation
- The procedure must be explained to the patient
- The paramedic should offer verbal support and encouragement
- **Onset of relief of symptoms usually begins to occur within five minutes**

### 7. Midazolam for CPAP Tolerance
Midazolam may be carefully considered for anxiety related to respiratory distress and the procedure:
- Midazolam may allow the patient to tolerate CPAP, thereby avoiding endotracheal intubation
- Midazolam may also decrease respiratory rate
- **Midazolam should be given in the lowest possible dose to achieve patient cooperation**
- Will likely only be required in the initial application of CPAP
- Anxiety will likely diminish once respiratory status begins to improve
- **The paramedic should be prepared for intubation if respiratory status worsens**

### 8. Nitroglycerin Administration with CPAP
- CPAP may be briefly removed to administer Nitroglycerin for CHF
- Ensure the entire tablet has dissolved prior to reapplying CPAP

### 9. CPAP Pressure Settings
CPAP must be used in accordance with manufacturer guidelines.

**Pressure Titration:**
- CPAP pressures should be titrated to desired effect, demonstrated by:
  - Improved respiratory status
  - Decrease in heart rate
  - Increase in SpO2
- **Pressure range:** 5 cm/water to a maximum of 15 cm/water
- **Typical settings:**
  - **10 cm/water** is effective for pulmonary edema
  - **5 cm/water** is effective for other respiratory complaints

### 10. Monitoring Requirements
Patients receiving CPAP require close observation of respiratory status and hemodynamic stability:

**Required vital sign monitoring:**
- Respiratory rate
- Heart rate
- Blood pressure
- SpO2

**Frequency:** Must be recorded **every five minutes** throughout treatment and transport until release from care

**Prepare to assist ventilation or intubate if patient condition worsens**

### 11. Transfer of Care Requirements
- Patients with CPAP in use may only be released to a paramedic with equal training for transport to the hospital
- In cases where the transport paramedic is not trained in the use of the device, **the paramedic who initiated CPAP must accompany the patient to the hospital**
