## Public Safety First Aid Procedures

### Adults and Pediatric
- Manage patients as per agency policy
- Request ambulance if medically necessary

---

## BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics Start Here

1. **Complete primary survey/ABC's**

2. **Apply NRB at 15 LPM to all combative patients requiring restraints**

3. **If altered mental status:**
   - Rule out treatable causes and apply restraints
   - If GCS = 15, apply restraints

4. **Assess blood glucose:**
   - If < 60 mg/dL, enter diabetic or altered mental status protocol if altered

---

## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic Only

1. **Assess blood glucose:**
   - If < 60 mg/dL, enter diabetic or altered mental status protocol if altered

2. **Chemical Restraint:**
   - **Midazolam 5 mg IM** or **2 mg IV** for agitation control

---

## Base Hospital Contact Required

### Adults
- **Midazolam 5 mg IM** or **2 mg IV**
- Base contact required **beyond initial dose** for agitation control

### Pediatric
- **Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IM** or **0.05 mg/kg IV**
- Not to exceed adult dose
- Base contact required **beyond initial dose** for agitation control

---

## Special Considerations

### 1. Use of Restraints
- Patients should be reassured, and their cooperation enlisted whenever possible
- **Restraints should only be used when the patient poses a danger to self or others** and all other measures to control patient behavior are inadequate

### 2. Restraint Application Methods
- Patients should be restrained using the **least restrictive means possible** to provide for the safety of the patient and persons providing care during treatment and transport
- **Two-point restraints** may be used to secure the patient's arms at the wrists
- **Four-point restraints** may be used to secure the patient's arms at the wrists and legs at the ankles
- **Patients must NEVER be transported prone**

### 3. Approved Restraint Devices
Only commercially manufactured devices intended for restraint may be used to restrain a patient.

### 4. Airway Monitoring Position
Restrained patients must be transported in a position that allows for monitoring and protection of the patient's airway.

### 5. Restraint Securement
- Restraints should be secured to a **non-moving part of a gurney**
- Tied in a fashion that will allow for **quick release**

### 6. Gurney Safety Belts
When a patient is restrained, gurney safety belts may be used to:
- Secure the legs above the knees
- Secure across the chest **without impeding expansion of respiration**
- **The patient's arms should be on the outside of the chest straps**

### 7. Handcuff Use
Handcuffs may only be used as restraint devices when a **law enforcement officer accompanies the patient in the ambulance**.

### 8. Monitoring Requirements
Transfer of patients that have been restrained requires careful and frequent monitoring of airway, breathing, and circulation.

**Required monitoring:**
- Pulse oximetry (when possible)
- ECG monitoring (when possible)
- **Capillary refill, warmth, and movement distal to the restraint**
  - Must be assessed **every fifteen (15) minutes** after restraint application
  - Must be documented on the ePCR

### 9. Physician Orders for Restraints
Transferring physicians that order the application or maintenance of physical or chemical restraint must provide a **written order**.

### 10. Additional Required Documentation

**Specific to this protocol, document:**
- Reasons restraints were applied
- Agencies and individuals involved in the application of the restraints
- Capillary refill, warmth, and movement distal to the restraint

### 11. Chemical Restraint - Additional Doses
- Agitation control **beyond the first dose requires a BASE STATION order**
- **Indications for agitation control:**
  - Extreme agitation in which patients cannot be safely restrained using physical restraints
  - Patient is a danger to ambulance personnel and/or self
- **The paramedic should be prepared to handle respiratory depression in chemically restrained patients**
