## XI. TRAUMA SYSTEM INTERFACILITY TRANSFER

A. As an inclusive trauma system, all hospitals will have a role in providing trauma care to injured patients.
   1. The Trauma Center(s) will be required to establish and maintain a transfer agreement with the Receiving Hospitals for the transfer of patients that meet "Trauma Triage Criteria".
   2. The Trauma Center is obligated to immediately accept all patients that meet trauma triage criteria from the Receiving Hospitals in Kern County unless hospital disaster closure or Med-Alert Routing status is in effect.
   3. Once the Trauma Center returns to open status, they are once again obligated to receive all trauma patient transfers that meet "Trauma Triage Criteria".

B. Initial management of patients the meet "Trauma Triage Criteria" should continue while efforts are made to transfer the patient.

C. To initiate a transfer, a call shall be placed by the Receiving Hospital emergency physician or emergency department R.N., to the Trauma Center emergency department attending physician.
   1. This phone call shall be answered by the Trauma Center emergency department attending physician immediately.
   2. The verbal report for transfer shall be physician to physician.

D. Transferring facilities, in conjunction with the Trauma Center(s), will be responsible for obtaining the appropriate level of transportation when transferring trauma patients within the time standard.
   1. Consideration of transport modality (ground vs air) should be a collaborative decision between transferring hospital and the Trauma Center, and should be based upon total time to the Trauma Center, not just shorter transport times.
      a. Mode of transport decisions should be made as soon as possible.
      b. The goal is to get any Red Tier trauma activation to the highest-level trauma center in the shortest amount of time, while still providing lifesaving stabilization as the patient transitions from scene to a Level I/II Trauma Center.
      c. If the patient is triaged as a Red Tier activation and is transported to a Trauma Receiving Hospital, level III or IV Trauma Center, rapid transfer should be initiated if appropriate as determined by the receiving trauma center.
   2. All patient transfers must meet the criteria listed in the California Code of Regulations – Title 22 – Article 5, COBRA requirements, and the California Health and Safety Code.
   3. Patients that meet "Trauma Triage Criteria" may be transferred between and from Trauma Centers providing that any transfer shall be, as determined by the Trauma Center surgeon of record medically prudent.

E. If a trauma patient meeting "Trauma Triage Criteria" or responsible party refuses patient transfer to the Trauma Center, the Trauma Center will be notified, and the Receiving Hospital should attempt to have an "Against Medical Advice" (AMA) form signed. A copy of the EMS AMA form will be submitted to the EMS Program in these cases. (See Appendix B).
