## 123 ACUTE STROKE/CVA

### Adults and Pediatrics

## Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only
- Assess ABC's
- Position patient with head elevated 30 degrees if practical and safe to do so
- Request Fire/EMS

## BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here
- Primary survey/ABC/Blood Glucose
- Apply oxygen only if less than 94% or if in respiratory distress
- Assess Cincinnati prehospital stroke scale (CPSS)
- Activate stroke alert if CPSS is positive
- Elevate patients' head 30 degrees, suction as needed to maintain patent airway
- If a patient is showing signs of hypoglycemia or narcosis enter appropriate protocol
- ALS rendezvous or transport to stroke center

## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only
- Monitor, IV and blood glucose
- If Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) positive and under 4 hours since last known normal expedite base contact and transport to appropriate facility in accordance with stroke policy

## Base Hospital Contact Required

## Special Considerations

1. Apply O2 only if pulse ox <94% or signs of respiratory distress.

2. No more than two (2) IV attempts.

3. Patients that present with altered mental status may be oriented to self, place, time and event, but are unable to communicate their orientation effectively.

4. **Perform Cincinnati prehospital stroke scale (CPSS):**

| Test | Findings |
|------|----------|
| **Facial Droop:** Have the patient show teeth or smile. | **Normal** – both sides of the face move equally.<br>**Abnormal** – one side of face does not move as well as the other side. |
| **Arm Drift:** Patient closes eyes and extends both arms straight out, with palms up, for 10 seconds. | **Normal** – both arms move the same or both arms do not move at all.<br>**Abnormal** – one arm does not move, or one arm drifts down compared with the other. |
| **Abnormal Speech:** Have the patient say, "you can't teach an old dog new tricks". | **Normal** – patient uses correct words with no slurring of words.<br>**Abnormal** – patient slurs words, uses the wrong words, or in unable to speak. |

5. Acute stroke with one or more abnormal Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) findings and last known normal at or within four (4) hours (observed by a valid historian), may be a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy.

6. Transport patients in semi-Fowler's position with no more than 30 degrees head elevation.
