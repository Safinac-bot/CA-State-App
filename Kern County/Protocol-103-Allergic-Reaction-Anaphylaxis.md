## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Signs and Symptoms of Severe Reaction (Anaphylaxis):

- Respiratory distress (including but not limited to wheezing, stridor, or signs of bronchospasm)
- Airway occlusion
- Swelling to face and/or tongue
- Tightness in throat and/or chest
- Loss of voice
- Hypotension/shock
- Exposure to known allergens with symptoms
- Itching and hives (with one or more of the symptoms listed above)

### 2. Mild Allergic Reactions

Mild allergic reactions usually require less aggressive therapy. Consider Diphenhydramine.

### 3. Epinephrine Drip 2-8 mcg/min Preparation:

**Epinephrine Drip:**
- Begin with a 100mL bag of normal saline and apply medication label to indicate epinephrine drip.
- Obtain 1 ampule or vial of epinephrine 1:1000
- With a 10mL syringe and a filtered needle withdraw 0.8mg of epinephrine 1:1000
- Remove filtered needle attach hypodermic needle and inject epinephrine 1:1000 in labeled 100mL saline bag. Shake well.
- Attach the 60 drops/mL IV tubing set to the extension set with flow controller (Dial-a-flow). Prime the line and set your desired drops, see below for rates.
  - **2mcg/min** set rate to 15 drops
  - **4mcg/min** set rate to 30 drops
  - **6mcg/min** set rate to 45 drops
  - **8mcg/min** set rate to 60 drops

### 4. Push Dose Epinephrine Indications

Push dose epinephrine or epinephrine drip is indicated for severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis or fast onset of symptoms. Push dose epinephrine is preferred over drip for continued severe allergic reaction. If patient fails to respond to push dose epinephrine or if you expect to have a long transport time epinephrine drip shall be used.

- Push dose epinephrine for profoundly hypotensive patients after standard treatments fail to improve blood pressure.
- Push dose epinephrine is 1mL (0.1 mg) of 1 mg in 10 mL epinephrine (cardiac epinephrine 1:10,000) mixed with 9 mL of N/S resulting in Epinephrine 0.01 mg/mL.

**Push Dose Epinephrine Preparation:**
- Begin with an empty 10mL syringe and apply a medication label to indicate push dose epinephrine.
- Withdraw 1 mL of 0.1 mg/mL preparation (cardiac epinephrine 1:10,000)
- Withdraw 9 mL of normal saline. Shake well.
- Mixture now provides 10 mL of epinephrine at a 10 mcg/mL concentration.
- **Push Dose:** 0.5 mL (5 mcg) IV/IO, every 1-5 minutes.

### 5. Diphenhydramine Indications

Diphenhydramine is indicated for use after epinephrine in patients with respiratory distress or hypoperfusion. Diphenhydramine is the primary therapy for idiosyncratic reactions to Haldol or phenothiazine medication group. Phenothiazine medication group reactions, Diphenhydramine IV push is indicated with bypass of other treatment listed in this protocol.
