## TREATMENT PROTOCOL

| **Adults** | **Pediatrics (13 years and under)** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** | **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** |
| • Begin High-Performance CPR<br>• Attach AED and follow prompts<br>• Ensure Fire/ALS have been requested | • Begin High-Performance CPR<br>• Attach AED and follow prompts use pediatric pads or dose attenuator if available<br>• Ensure Fire/ALS have been requested |
| **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** | **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** |
| • Begin High-Performance CPR<br>• Attach AED/monitor and follow prompts<br>• Pulse checks every 2 minutes for no longer than 10 seconds<br>• Rapid transport or ALS rendezvous if ROSC<br>• If no change after 30 minutes, consider termination of efforts per determination of death policy | • Begin High-Performance CPR<br>• Attach AED/monitor and follow prompts use pediatric pads or dose attenuator if available<br>• Pulse checks every 2 minutes for no longer than 10 seconds<br>• Request ALS rendezvous. Initiate transport if ALS ETA is greater than 10 min |
| **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** | **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** |
| • Monitor/EtCO2<br>• When IV/IO established give Epinephrine IV drip 2-8 mcg/min repeat as needed. Start at 8mcg/min and titrate down once ROSC is achieved.<br>• Consider H's and T's<br>• Suspected Hyperkalemia? If yes, give Calcium Chloride 20mg/kg<br>• Consider fluid challenge 20mL/kg<br>• If no change after 30 minutes, consider termination of efforts per determination of death policy<br>• Enter V-FIB/Pulseless V-TACH Protocol (126) as needed for rhythm change | • Monitor/EtCO2<br>• When IV/IO established give Epinephrine IV drip 0.1-1 mcg/kg/min not to exceed adult dose repeat as needed. Start at higher dose and titrate down once ROSC is achieved.<br>• Consider H's and T's<br>• Suspected Hyperkalemia? If yes, give Calcium Chloride 20mg/kg<br>• Consider fluid challenge 20mL/kg<br>• Transport after 10 minutes of High-Performance CPR or if ROSC is achieved.<br>• Enter V-FIB/Pulseless V-TACH Protocol (126) as needed for rhythm change |

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Epinephrine Drip 2-8 mcg/min Preparation:

**Epinephrine Drip Setup:**
- Begin with a 100mL bag of normal saline and apply medication label to indicate epinephrine drip.
- Obtain 1 ampule or vial of epinephrine 1:1000
- With a 1 mL syringe and a filtered needle withdraw 0.8mg of epinephrine 1:1000
- Remove filtered needle, attach hypodermic needle and inject 0.8mg of epinephrine 1:1000 in labeled 100mL saline bag. Shake well.
- Attach the 60 drops/mL IV tubing set to the extension set with flow controller (Dial-a-flow). Prime the line and set your desired drops, see below for rates.
  - **2mcg/min** set rate to 15 drops
  - **4mcg/min** set rate to 30 drops
  - **6mcg/min** set rate to 45 drops
  - **8mcg/min** set rate to 60 drops

### 2. H's and T's - Reversible Causes of PEA

The most common and easily reversible causes of PEA are **hypovolemia** and **hypoxia**. The best chance of success in treating PEA is to recognize and treat the underlying cause. The most common causes of PEA are presented in the H's and T's table below:

| **H's** | **T's** |
|---------|---------|
| Hypovolemia | Toxins |
| Hypoxia | Tamponade (cardiac) |
| Hydrogen ion (acidosis) | Tension Pneumothorax |
| Hyper/hypokalemia | Thrombosis (coronary and pulmonary) |
| Hypoglycemia | Trauma |
| Hypothermia | |

### 3. Confirming Asystole

Asystole should be confirmed in 3 leads and other causes of a flat line on the monitor should be ruled out. Causes of a flat line on the monitor, other than asystole include:
- Loose leads
- Leads not connected to the patient or the monitor
- No power
- Signal gain too low

### 4. Prognosis for Asystole

Prognosis for asystole is very poor and is usually seen as confirmation of death. Prolonged efforts at resuscitation of asystole are unnecessary and futile unless special resuscitation situations exist, such as hypothermia and drug overdose.

### 5. Transcutaneous Pacing

Transcutaneous pacing is **not indicated** for asystole.

### 6. Shock Administration

Routine shock of asystole is not indicated unless it is questionable whether the patient is in asystole or fine ventricular fibrillation.

### 7. Termination of Resuscitation

If a reversible cause is not rapidly identified and the patient fails to respond to resuscitative efforts, termination of resuscitation should be considered.
