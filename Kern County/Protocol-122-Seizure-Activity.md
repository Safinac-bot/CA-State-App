## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Naloxone Consideration

Consider Naloxone in situations of potential drug abuse or if there is no history of seizure disorder.

### 2. Seizure Types and Airway Management

Seizures present in several forms. A generalized motor seizure (Grand Mal) is the most common witnessed in the field. Generalized motor seizure activity frequently affects a victim's ability to breathe. Proper assessment of the patient's airway and ventilatory status is critical to the field management of these patients.

### 3. Medication Administration Route - IM Preferred

If IV access has not been established: Initial IM/IN dosing should be administered immediately for active seizures. **Intramuscular administration is preferred for all patients.**

### 4. IV Access During Active Seizure

**Do not attempt IV access during an active seizure.**

### 5. Midazolam Respiratory Depression Risk

Midazolam is associated with a higher degree of respiratory depression than Diazepam, be prepared to manage the airway with the administration of any benzodiazepine. Midazolam IM is the preferred first line therapy for pediatric patients. Be sure to wait approximately 10 minutes before repeating doses by IM route. Midazolam has been shown to have an onset of action of 10 minutes with peak action in 30 min.

### 6. Midazolam Intranasal Volume Limits

Midazolam given intranasal has a volume limit of **1 mL per nare**. More than 1 mL per nare will simply run off and not be absorbed. Midazolam concentration of 5 mg/mL vial is preferred as the volume limit will not be reached with a max single dose of 10mg, however multiple concentrations of the drug are to be avoided in MICU inventory due to potential medication errors.

### 7. Diazepam Administration in Pediatrics

Diazepam is preferably administered IV push, but in the pediatric patient it may be administered via the rectum if IV access is not available.

### 8. Status Epilepticus Definition

Status epilepticus is manifested by two or more seizures without regaining consciousness in between seizures or continuous seizure activity without cessation.

### 9. Status Epilepticus - Airway Priority

The highest risk for patients with continuous generalized seizures (status epilepticus) is **hypoxia**. Airway and ventilation to resolve hypoxia is a high patient care priority. ET intubation and ventilation should be used if indicated.
