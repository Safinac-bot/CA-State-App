## I. Purpose

To define training requirements, indications, guidelines, and the standard procedure for access of pre-existing central vascular access devices (CVAD) on critically ill patients.

---

## II. Authority

- Health and Safety Code, Section 1797.220, 1798
- Title 22, Section 100170

---

## III. Definitions

### A. Pre-existing Vascular Access Device (PVAD)
An indwelling catheter or device placed into a central vein to provide vascular access for long term use or hemodialysis.

### 1. Externally Accessible Central Venous Line
- External central venous catheter; may be single or multi-lumen
- Usually located in subclavian, jugular or femoral veins
- Often called a **PICC line** (peripherally inserted central catheter) or central venous catheter
- Accessed through injection cap

### 2. Tunneled Temporary or Permanent Dialysis Catheter
- External central venous catheter with two lumens
- Usually located in the subclavian vein and located on the anterior chest
- Occasionally it may be found in the femoral or jugular
- **This shall only be used in unstable patients with impending or existing cardiac arrest with no other option for vascular access**

### 3. Hemodialysis Fistula/Graft
- A permanent surgical connection that diverts blood flow from an artery to a vein
- Usually located on the upper extremity and is used for dialysis
- **This shall NOT be used by prehospital personnel**

### 4. Internal Indwelling Catheter
- Tunneled and implanted long term port
- Usually on the chest wall or arm
- No external lumens noted
- **This device is NOT to be used by prehospital personnel**

---

## IV. Policy

PVADs may be used in the prehospital setting as set forth by this document.

### A. Training Requirements
Paramedics shall successfully complete a PVAD training module approved by Kern County EMS Agency and have skill checked off by an approved trainer prior to administering fluids and/or medications through a PVAD.

### B. Indications

#### a. Existing Peripheral Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) or Central Venous Catheter (CVC)
- May be used in any situation as long as patency is established

#### b. External Central Venous Catheters (Dialysis Catheter)
- May be used in unstable patients with impending arrest when no other access can be established

### C. Documentation Requirements

**Documentation will include:**
- Date and time device accessed
- Type of device accessed
- Prior attempts to establish peripheral access
- Patient's condition requiring device to be accessed
- Any complications encountered
- Medication dosages and/or total amount of fluids administered

### D. Risks

1. Introduction of an air embolism (and possible stroke, heart attack, or end organ damage)
2. Uncontrolled bleeding
3. Blood or local skin infection
4. Loss of access in a difficult venous access patient

---

## Procedure

### A. Externally Accessible Central Venous Line or Peripheral Inserted Central Catheter

#### 1. Assemble Necessary Equipment
- Appropriate PPE
- Two 10 cc syringes; 1 empty and 1 with 10 cc NS
- IV tubing and fluids
- Alcohol prep pads

#### 2. Patient Education
Educate the patient on the procedure

#### 3. Hand Hygiene and PPE
Perform hand hygiene and don exam gloves

#### 4. Disconnect Existing Lines
Disconnect any existing IV lines

#### 5. Prep Injection Caps
Vigorously scrub the top and sides of needleless connector hub with alcohol prep pad using friction and a twisting motion for **no less than 15 seconds**

#### 6. Air-Dry
Allow to completely air-dry

#### 7. Assess Patency and Flush IV Catheter Prior to Medication Administration

#### 8. Attach Empty Syringe
Attach empty 10 cc syringe and unclamp catheter

#### 9. Withdraw Blood
Withdraw 5 cc of blood and discard. **If at any time resistance is met, discontinue the procedure**

#### 10. Flush with Saline
Slowly inject 5-10 cc of normal saline with prefilled syringe. **If at any time resistance is met, discontinue the procedure**

#### 11. Attach IV Tubing
Use a new alcohol prep pad to clean the needleless connector using friction and a twisting motion for **no less than 15 seconds** and allow to completely air dry and attach IV tubing. Once it is flowing well, it can be used for medication administration

#### 12. Monitor Site
Closely monitor site

#### 13. Medication Administration
- Connect the medication syringe or administration set maintaining sterility of syringe or line tip
- Administer medication

#### 14. Post Medication Administration/Flush
- Discard supplies
- Remove gloves
- Perform hand hygiene
- Document procedure

## Special Considerations

### 1. Aspiration and Flushing
CVADs are aspirated for blood return and flushed prior to each infusion to assess catheter function and prevent complications.

### 2. Post-Infusion Flushing
CVADs are flushed after each infusion to clear the infused medication from the catheter lumen, thereby reducing the risk of contact between incompatible medications.

### 3. Single-Use Syringes
Single-use flushing and locking syringes are used.

### 4. No Reuse
Single use normal saline flushing syringes are **never re-used** even on same lumen.

### 5. Patency Assessment
The patency of the CVAD is assessed using a **10-ml syringe** to reduce the risk of catheter damage.

### 6. Recommended Flushing/Locking Solution
10 mL prefilled normal saline syringe.

### 7. Never Force Flush
A CVAD is **never forcibly flushed**.

### 8. Red Catheter Port - Never Access
**Never access red catheter port.**

### 9. Red Catheter Port - Always Clamp
**Always clamp red catheter port before procedure is initiated.**

### 10. Locking After Final Flush
The CVAD may be locked after the final flush to maintain patency and decrease the risk of intra-luminal occlusion.

### 11. No IV Solution Containers for Flush
Do **not** use intravenous (IV) solution containers (e.g., bags or bottles) as a source for obtaining flush solutions.

### 12. Syringe Sizing After Patency Confirmation
After confirmation of patency using a 10-ml syringe, use syringes appropriately sized for the medication being injected.

### 13. Recommended Flushing/Locking Solution
10 mL prefilled normal saline syringe.

### 14. Pulsatile Flushing Technique
Flush before and after use using vigorously pulsatile technique.
