- 4 officers as a minimum are recommended for subdual while paramedic personnel sedate patient and restrain once sedation has taken effect

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)

## BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics Start Here

### Adults
- Request ALS
- Ensure law enforcement is enroute or at scene
- 4 officers as a minimum are recommended for subdual while paramedic personnel prepare agitation control and has taken effect
- If scene is determined to be safe, attempt verbal de-escalation with a calm, reassuring approach and manner

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Request ALS
- Ensure law enforcement is enroute or at scene
- 4 officers as a minimum are recommended for subdual while paramedic personnel prepare agitation control and has taken effect

## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic Only

### Adults

**Initial Assessment:**
- Once patient contact is established and an assessment can be performed safely:
  - Establish primary assessment and patient stabilization of life-threatening conditions
  - Perform risk assessment for potential cause/causes of agitation, coexisting medical conditions, and risk for cardiac and/or respiratory deterioration

**Medication Options:**

**Option 1: Cooperative Patient**
- Administer **Olanzapine 10 mg PO** single dose for cooperative, anxious patients with behavioral health presentation and with a history of psychiatric disorder
  - Restraints may be utilized after medication administration

**Option 2: Physical Restraint Required**
- If patient physical restraint is necessary to assure patient and/or EMS provider safety, prehospital personnel must ensure there is sufficient personnel present to physically restrain the patient safely
  - When law enforcement and paramedic has developed a plan and is ready, law enforcement will subdue the patient and apply appropriate restraint devices
  - Law enforcement and paramedic should try to eliminate any pressure to the back, chest, or neck while subduing the patient and avoid putting the patient in the prone position

**Chemical Restraint Protocol:**
1. Administer **Midazolam 5 mg IM/IN** for agitation control
2. If no response in 5 minutes, administer **Droperidol 5 mg IM** single dose
3. If no response after 5 minutes, may repeat an additional **Midazolam 5 mg IM/IN**

**Transport:**
- Rapid transport to closest appropriate facility with law enforcement in attendance

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- See Adult Protocol for physical restraint usage/transport decisions
- **There are NO approved medications/chemical restraints for pediatrics without base hospital contact**

---

## Base Hospital Contact Required

### Adults
- Beyond initial dosing

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Administer **Midazolam for agitation control:** 0.1 mg/kg IM/IN

## Special Considerations

### 1. Olanzapine (Zyprexa)

#### A. Indication
For cooperative, anxious adult patients with a primarily behavioral health presentation and a history of psychiatric disorder. These patients will commonly hear voices or have paranoid thoughts after not taking their usual psychiatric medications.

#### B. Administration
- Medication should be handed to the patient for sublingual self-administration
- Patient must be willing to take olanzapine willingly with no assistance from EMS personnel
- No water is needed for the orally disintegrating tablet

#### C. Precautions
- Hyperglycemia
- Dystonic Reactions
- Anticholinergic Effects
- Altered mental status
- Generalized Weakness
- High Fever
- Excessive sweating
- Central Nervous System Depression
- Arrhythmias

#### D. Contraindications
- Alzheimer's disease
- Breast Cancer
- Patients less than 18 years of age
- Pregnant patients
- Seizures

### 2. Droperidol (Inapsine)

#### A. Indications
Agitated patients who pose serious probable and imminent bodily harm to self/others. They will have some or all the following symptoms:
- Paranoia
- Disorientation
- Hyper-aggression
- Hallucination
- Tachycardia
- Diaphoresis
- Increased strength
- Hyperthermia

#### B. Precautions
- Anticholinergic effect
- CNS depression
- Extrapyramidal
- Hyperprolactinemia
- Orthostatic Hypotension
- Temperature regulation
- Arrhythmias

#### C. Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity
- Pediatrics

---

### 3. Monitoring Requirements (If Droperidol or Midazolam is Administered)

**Required monitoring and interventions:**

a) Monitor airway and intervene if airway becomes compromised

b) Administer high flow oxygen unless medically contraindicated
   - Use caution with COPD or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure

c) Continuous monitoring:
   - Cardiac monitoring
   - Capnography
   - SpO2 monitoring

d) Start 2 large bore IVs

e) Check blood glucose

### 4. Decision Authority

The decision to chemically restrain a patient is a **medical decision, not a law enforcement decision**.

**The "Not A Crime" Mnemonic** may be helpful in recognizing these patients.
