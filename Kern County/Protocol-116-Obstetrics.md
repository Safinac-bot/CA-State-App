## TREATMENT PROTOCOL

### Obstetric Patients

#### Public Safety First Aid Procedures: only

- Support ABC's
- Place patient in position of comfort
- Request EMS

#### BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here

- Complete primary survey/ABC's
- Give oxygen only if SpO2 <94% or if in respiratory distress
- **Active Labor** - If signs of active labor present (contractions, membrane rupture, or bloody show), but no imminent deliver, transport to the appropriate receiving facility.
  - Transport pregnant patient on their left side.
- **Imminent Delivery** - If signs of imminent delivery present (crowning or other presentation in vaginal opening, urge to push, etc.) proceed with delivery, unless complicated delivery is suspected. If complicated delivery is suspected initiate immediate transport.
  - Ensure ALS is in route.
  - Use hands to prevent explosive delivery.
  - Support infant's head as needed, gently guide head up to allow delivery of shoulders, and then slowly deliver the remainder of the infant.
  - After 1 minute or when cord stops pulsating, clamp and cut the cord 6-8 inches from newborn
  - Assess Newborn with APGAR score at 1&5 minutes.
  - Perform fundus massage following delivery of placenta.

#### ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only

- **Pitocin (Oxytocin)** administer immediately after birth of infant.
  - 10 units IM.
- **Postpartum Hemorrhage** Consider TXA
  - If estimated blood loss greater than or equal to 1000 mL with continued bleeding, administer 1 gram of Tranexamic Acid over 10 minutes. Mix 1 gram (10 mL) in 100 mL of NS and infuse via:
    - Macro 10gtts/mL over 10 minutes @ 110 gtts.
  - May repeat after 30 min.

#### Base Hospital Contact Required

**Postpartum Hemorrhage (Under 18y/o)**
- Consider TXA
- If estimated blood loss greater than or equal to 1000 mL with continued bleeding, administer 1 gram of Tranexamic Acid over 10 minutes. Mix 1 gram (10 mL) in 100 mL of NS and infuse via:
  - Macro 10gtts/mL over 10 minutes @ 110 gtts.

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Complicated Deliveries

For all complicated deliveries, BLS should request to rendezvous with ALS if ALS is closer than an OB destination, but should start toward an OB destination. Complicated deliveries include presenting part other than head, prolapsed cord, placenta previa, abruptio placenta, shoulder dystocia if initial maneuvers are not successful or if the patient indicates that they were a high-risk pregnancy.

### 2. Airway Suctioning

Do **NOT** routinely suction the infant's airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery. Only if respiratory distress is noted.

### 3. Cord Clamping

After 1 minute, clamp cord about 6-8 inches from the infant's abdomen with two clamps; cut the cord between the clamps.
- If resuscitation is needed, the baby can still benefit from a 1-minute delay in cord clamping. Start resuscitation immediately after birth and then clamp and cut the cord at 1 minute.
- While cord is attached, take care to ensure the baby is not significantly higher positioned than the mother to prevent blood from flowing backwards from baby to placenta.

### 4. APGAR Scoring

Resuscitation takes priority over recording APGAR scores. Record APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes once neonate is stabilized.

### 5. Placenta Delivery

The placenta will deliver spontaneously 5–15 minutes after the infant is delivered. In some cases, placenta may not deliver until up to an hour after delivery.
- Do not force the placenta to deliver; do not pull on the umbilical cord
- Contain all tissue in plastic bag and transport

### 6. Abruptio Placenta

Most frequently occurs in third trimester of pregnancy; placenta prematurely separates from the uterus causing intrauterine bleeding.
- Lower abdominal pain, uterine rigidity (often not present until abruption is advanced)
- Vaginal bleeding – this symptom may not occur in cases of concealed abruption
- Clinical index of suspicion for abruption (history of trauma, maternal hypertension, maternal drug use especially cocaine)
- Shock, with minimal or no vaginal bleeding

### 7. Placenta Previa

Placenta covers part or the entire cervical opening.
- Generally, late second or third trimester
- Painless vaginal bleeding, unless in active labor

### 8. Ectopic Pregnancy

- First trimester
- Abdominal/pelvic pain with or without minimal bleeding
- Shock is possible even with minimal or no vaginal bleeding

### 9. Spontaneous Abortion (Miscarriage)

- Generally, first trimester
- Intermittent pelvic pain (uterine contractions) with vaginal bleeding/passage of clots or tissue

### 10. Spina Bifida (Birth Defect)

- Keep clean
- Place moist sterile gauze

### 11. Omphalocele (Birth Defect)

- Keep clean
- Place moist sterile gauze

## IMPORTANT NOTE

**Most deliveries proceed without complications** – If complications of delivery occur, apply high flow oxygen to mother and expedite transport to the appropriate receiving facility. Maternal resuscitation is critical for best fetal outcome. Contact medical direction and/or closest appropriate receiving facility for direct medical oversight and to prepare the receiving team.

## COMPLICATED DELIVERIES

### Prolapsed Cord

- **Position** - Place pregnant patient with hips elevated on pillows or knees to chest (Shock Position)
- **Protect Umbilical Cord** - Insert gloved hand into vagina and gently push presenting part off cord.
- **Transport** - while protecting the umbilical cord.

### Shoulder Dystocia

- If infants' shoulders get stuck during vaginal delivery perform **McRoberts Maneuver**.
- Elevate both knees to the patient's chest.
- Apply suprapubic pressure by pushing above the pubic bone towards the direction the head is facing.
- Do this to try to dislodge the shoulder.

### Nuchal Cord

- After the head has been delivered, palpate the neck for presence of nuchal cord. If present, slip over the head or over the shoulders.
- If the cord is too tight to slip over the head or shoulders, clamp the cord on two sections and cut between the clamps; the newborn should be delivered promptly.
