## TREATMENT PROTOCOL

| **Adults** | **Pediatrics (13 years and under)** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** | **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** |
| • Request Fire/EMS<br>• Support ABC's<br>• Encourage the patient to remain still in position of comfort<br>• Control external bleeding as needed | • Request Fire/EMS<br>• Support ABC's<br>• Encourage the patient to remain still in position of comfort<br>• Control external bleeding as needed |
| **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** | **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** |
| • Perform assessment<br>• Spinal motion restriction if indicated<br>• Administer O2 if SpO2 <94% or if in respiratory distress; HOWEVER, apply high flow oxygen to all patients with head injury and altered level of consciousness or loss of consciousness.<br>• **If Head injury:** Perform neuro assessment, monitor airway, control hemorrhage. If a patient is unresponsive or rapidly declining LOC consider supraglottic airway<br>• **If Ear injury:** Control external hemorrhage with direct pressure, apply dressing DO NOT pack ear canal<br>• **If Eye injury:** Trauma, loosely cover both eyes/ stabilize impaled objects. Chemical: Determine chemical/follow SDS or Label directions for eye injuries, if unavailable irrigate with water for 20 minutes. Cover both eyes.<br>• Prepare for transport if patient becomes unstable provide rapid transport or ALS rendezvous | • Perform assessment<br>• Spinal motion restriction if indicated<br>• Administer O2 if SpO2 <94% or if in respiratory distress; HOWEVER, apply high flow oxygen to all patients with head injury and altered level of consciousness or loss of consciousness.<br>• **If Head injury:** Perform neuro assessment, monitor airway, control hemorrhage. If a patient is unresponsive or rapidly declining LOC consider Ventilation with BVM<br>• **If Ear injury:** Control external hemorrhage with direct pressure, apply dressing. DO NOT pack ear canal<br>• **If Eye injury:** Trauma, loosely cover both eyes/ stabilize impaled objects. Chemical: Determine chemical/follow SDS or Label directions for eye injuries, if unavailable irrigate with water for 20 min. Cover both eyes<br>• Prepare for transport if patient becomes unstable provide rapid transport or ALS rendezvous |
| **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** | **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** |
| • If a patient is unresponsive or rapidly declining level of consciousness, consider ET intubation.<br>• **Closed Head Injury:** If altered level of consciousness or loss of consciousness, give 1000mL IV fluid bolus and may repeat 500mL bolus to maintain BP over 90mm/Hg.<br>• Establish large bore IV/IO | • If a patient is unresponsive or rapidly declining level of consciousness, consider supraglottic airway device only if unable to ventilate.<br>• If an altered level of consciousness or loss of consciousness due to head injury, give 20mL/kg bolus with 10mL/kg repeat bolus to maintain BP over 70 + 2x(Age).<br>• Establish large bore IV/IO |

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Endotracheal Intubation Indication

Endotracheal intubation should be considered for patients > 13 years with a Glasgow Coma Score of 8 or less.

### 2. Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) Ventilation Rates

If BVM is needed for ventilation:
- **Adults:** ventilate at 10 breaths per minute
- **Pediatrics:** ventilate at 20 breaths per minute
- **Infants:** ventilate at 25 breaths per minute

**DO NOT HYPERVENTILATE.** Maintain End-Tidal 35-45 and use airway adjuncts with enough personnel to ventilate adequately.

### 3. Cushing's Triad

Cushing's Triad is associated with increased intracranial pressure and is manifested by:
- Decreased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure
- Increased or irregular respiratory rate

Decompensation can be rapid once blood pressure and respiratory rate begin to drop.

### 4. Fluid Management in Trauma

Fluid challenges in trauma patients should be avoided unless otherwise advised by trauma facility.

## KEY MANAGEMENT POINTS

### Head Injury:
- Perform neurological assessment
- Monitor airway closely
- Control hemorrhage
- High-flow oxygen for altered/loss of consciousness
- Maintain BP >90 mmHg (adults) or >70 + 2x(Age) (pediatrics)

### Eye Injury:
- **Trauma:** Loosely cover BOTH eyes, stabilize impaled objects
- **Chemical:** Determine chemical via SDS/label, irrigate 20 minutes if directions unavailable
- Always cover both eyes after treatment

### Ear Injury:
- Control external hemorrhage with direct pressure
- Apply dressing
- **DO NOT pack ear canal**
