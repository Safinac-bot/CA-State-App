## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Assessment Priority

Vomiting is a sign and symptom of illness or disease. Assess patients for potential illness or injury.

### 2. Inhaled Isopropyl Alcohol Administration

Inhaled isopropyl alcohol: have patient inhale through their nose with an alcohol prep pad below the nares.

### 3. Ondansetron Administration

Ondansetron is indicated for patients with nausea/vomiting. IV administration must be given over 1-2 minutes. Rapid administration results in increased side effects and may result in a syncopal episode.

### 4. Side Effects

Side effects include:
- Hypotension
- Dizziness
- Anaphylaxis
- Flushing
- Rash
- Headache
- Diarrhea
- Syncope
- QT prolongation

### 5. Ondansetron Contraindications

Ondansetron is contraindicated in patients:
- Less than 4 years of age
- History of hypersensitivity to Ondansetron or similar medications (Dolasetron (Anzemet), Granisetron (Kytril), or Palonosetron (Aloxi)
- Patients taking Apomorphine (Apokyn, Ixense, Spontane, Uprima) – an injectable drug for Parkinson's disease and in rare cases used for erectile dysfunction
- Do not give oral tablet or solution to known Phenylketonurics (contains phenylalanine)

### 6. Oral Disintegrating Tablet Administration

Oral disintegrating tablets can be placed on tongue and do not need to be chewed. Medication will dissolve and be swallowed with saliva. **This is the preferred method of drug administration.**

### 7. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Ondansetron can be used in pregnancy and breast-feeding mothers.

### 8. Pain Management Cross-Reference

Ondansetron may be used for nausea/vomiting associated with the use of Morphine (see pain protocol).
