## TREATMENT PROTOCOL

| **Adults** | **Pediatrics (13 years and under)** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** | **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** |
| • Support ABC'S and clear airway as appropriate.<br>• Provide O2 to support respiration.<br>• Request EMS. | • Support ABC'S and clear airway as appropriate.<br>• Provide O2 to support respiration.<br>• Request EMS. |
| **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** | **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** |
| • Primary survey and ABC's, Pulse oximetry, and give Oxygen only if SpO2 <94% or respiratory distress.<br>• If a patient is able to talk, calm the patient, do not attempt to examine throat or dislodge potential obstruction.<br>• Suction secretions as needed.<br>• If a patient is unable to talk or cough but is conscious, perform Heimlich maneuver per AHA guidelines.<br>• If patient is unconscious, open airway, position head and attempt to ventilate. Remove obstruction with finger sweep ONLY IF VISIBLE. Reassess and attempt to ventilate. If unable to ventilate begin CPR and refer to Pulseless Arrest Entry Algorithm protocol (119). | • For BLS procedures, refer to Adult |
| **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** | **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** |
| • Attempt to clear using direct laryngoscopy and forceps.<br>• If there is no success, attempt to intubate using small adult ET tube.<br>• If complete airway obstruction or occlusion with inability to ventilate NOT due to foreign object, attempt ET Intubation with small adult ET tube. | • Attempt to clear using direct laryngoscopy and forceps.<br>• If there is no success, rapid transport to the closest most appropriate facility.<br>• If complete airway obstruction or occlusion with inability to ventilate NOT due to foreign object attempt to utilize smaller supraglottic airway and refer to Respiratory Compromise (121) |
| **Base Hospital Contact Required** | **Base Hospital Contact Required** |

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. Airway obstruction is characterized by the inability to speak, no respiratory tidal volume and decline of condition. Treatment of complete airway obstruction using this protocol takes precedence over all other protocols.

2. Laryngoscopy and assessment of factors leading to the event may be required to adequately assess the cause of airway obstruction.

3. If epiglottitis, laryngeal swelling, anaphylaxis, or spasm caused by burns is suspected, do not attempt to visualize airway until prepared to intubate.

4. Heimlich maneuver is the current accepted practice for airway obstruction due to foreign objects. Refer to AHA guidelines for appropriate age/size procedure.

5. When the airway is successfully cleared, ventilate, and refer to the appropriate protocol for further treatment.

6. If patient is < 1-year alternate between 5 back blows and 5 chest thrust to attempt to dislodge obstruction.
