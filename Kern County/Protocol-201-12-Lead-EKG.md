## Purpose

To provide a procedure for the performance of 12-lead EKG monitoring and reporting.

**This procedure is limited to use by paramedics only.**

---

## 1. Definitions

### A. 12 Lead EKG
A transthoracic interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the outer surface of the skin and recorded by a device external to the body.

### B. STEMI (ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction)
>1mm ST-segment elevation in two contiguous leads (either precordial or limb leads). (ACC/AHA)

### C. STEMI Alert
A declaration by prehospital personnel notifying a STEMI Receiving Center (SRC) that a patient has a specific computer-interpreted 12 Lead EKG indicating an Acute MI, allowing the STEMI Receiving Center to initiate the internal procedures to provide appropriate and rapid treatment interventions, or in consultation with the base physician regarding paramedic concern for STEMI not recognized by the machine.

### D. STEMI Receiving Center (SRC)
A facility licensed and operating a cardiac catheterization laboratory and designated an SRC by the Kern County Emergency Medical Services Program.

### E. STEMI Referral Hospital (SRH)
An acute care hospital in Kern County that is not designated as a STEMI Receiving Center.

### F. Acute Coronary Syndrome
Sudden lack of oxygen to the heart muscle.

### G. Hemodynamically Stable
Alert, systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mmHg, and cardiac rhythm does not pose an immediate life threat.

---

## 2. Indications

### A. Required 12 Lead EKG Performance

**12 Lead EKG shall be performed on patients exhibiting ANY of the following signs/symptoms:**

- Chest pain or pressure
- Upper abdominal pain
- Syncope or dizziness
- Shortness of breath
- Pain/discomfort is often associated with cardiac ischemia:
  - Jaw, neck, shoulder, back, left arm or other presentation; unless no other symptoms exist, and the cause of the specific pain can be identified with a traumatic or musculoskeletal injury
  - If there is any doubt about the origin of the pain/discomfort, or the presentation seems atypical for the mechanism, a 12 lead EKG should be performed

### B. Consider 12 Lead EKG

**Patients exhibiting the following signs/symptoms should have a 12 lead EKG performed if:**
- The etiology of the illness is indicative of an Acute Coronary Syndrome; **OR**
- The etiology of the illness is indeterminate

**Signs/symptoms:**
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diaphoresis
- Patient expression of "feelings of doom"

### C. Clinical Judgment
A 12 lead EKG may be performed based on the clinical judgment of the paramedic even in the absence of the above signs/symptoms.

### D. Serial EKGs
Consider repeat or serial EKG for any changes in:
- Rhythm
- ST changes
- Chief complaint and hemodynamic status

## 3. EKG Performance Procedure

### A. Oxygen Administration
- Administer oxygen if SpO2 < 94% or in respiratory distress
- Titrate oxygen only to use minimal amount needed
- **In general, O2 should not be given to chest pain patients unless they are hypoxic or in severe respiratory distress**

### B. Patient Assessment
Provide a thorough patient assessment including baseline vital signs.

### C. Apply Limb Leads
Apply limb leads (I, II and III) to determine rhythm or dysrhythmia.

### D. Hemodynamically Stable Patients
If the patient is hemodynamically stable, conduct the 12 lead EKG **prior to administration of medication**.

### E. Hemodynamically Unstable Patients
If the patient is not hemodynamically stable:
- Immediately provide appropriate treatment
- Perform the 12 lead EKG once the patient's condition stabilizes or time permits

### F. Patient Deterioration During EKG
If at any time during the application or performance of the 12 Lead EKG the patient's condition deteriorates:
- Immediately administer appropriate treatment
- Then proceed to the performance of the 12 lead EKG once the patient's condition stabilizes or time permits

## 4. Lead Placement

### A. Limb Leads (at least 10cm from the heart)
- **Black** – Left shoulder or arm
- **White** – Right shoulder or arm
- **Red** – Left leg
- **Green** – Right leg

### B. Chest Leads
- **V1:** Right 4th intercostal space (adjacent to sternum)
- **V2:** Left 4th intercostal space (adjacent to sternum)
- **V3:** Halfway between V2 and V4
- **V4:** Left 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line
- **V5:** Horizontal to V4, anterior axillary line
- **V6:** Horizontal to V5, mid-axillary line

**Note:** To find the 4th intercostal space, first locate the Angle of Louis. This is a hump near the top third of the sternum. Start feeling down the sternum from the top and you will feel it. It is located next to the second rib. The space directly beneath it is the 2nd intercostal space. Count down 2 additional intercostal spaces and place V1 on the right and V2 on the left immediately adjacent to the sternum.

## 5. STEMI Alert

### A. STEMI Alert Trigger
The monitor's interpretation, on the printed 12 Lead EKG, shall be the trigger for the notification of a "STEMI Alert."

### B. Positive "Acute MI" Indication on Printed 12 Lead EKG

**Ensure that tracing is as clean as possible. Artifact can cause the device to misidentify STEMI.**

**Transport Decision:**
- If available, patient shall be transported to a **"STEMI Receiving Center"**
- Outlying hospitals may be bypassed entirely if total transport time to a "STEMI Receiving Center" is less than one hour either by Air or Ground

**Notification:**
- Contact the "STEMI Receiving Center" to which the patient will be transported **within 5 minutes of 12 lead acquisition**
- Provide a brief report that **begins with the phrase "STEMI Alert"**
- Report should include:
  - Patient's age
  - Gender
  - Duration of symptoms
  - Pertinent presentation symptoms
  - 12 Lead EKG findings
  - ETA to the hospital

**EKG Transmission:**
- If transporting to a "STEMI Receiving Center" and time permits, electronically transmit the 12 Lead EKG for physician verification
- Consider establishing a second IV during transport if time permits

### C. Paramedic-Identified STEMI (Not Recognized by Machine)
If the cardiac monitor does not read STEMI but Paramedic feels that the ECG is consistent:
- Paramedic may transmit the ECG and discuss with base physician to activate
- If unable to transmit, the paramedic must be able to adequately describe the ECG to the base physician

**Important Notes:**
- Do not withhold treatment of chest pain if the 12 Lead EKG does not indicate "Acute MI"
- Lack of "Acute MI" indication on the 12 Lead EKG does not rule out the possibility of infarct or ischemia

### D. Transport Update
If a "STEMI Alert" report was called to the "STEMI Receiving Center", an update should be given during transport, time permitting.

## 6. Documentation

**Required copies of 12 lead EKG:**
- A copy must be maintained by the transporting agency
- A copy given to the hospital ED for inclusion in the patient chart
- A copy made available to EMS upon request

**The 12 lead EKG print-out shall be presented to hospital staff at the time the patient is delivered.**
