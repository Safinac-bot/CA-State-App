## Public Safety First Aid Procedures

### Adults
- Begin High-Performance CPR if no signs of obvious death
- Attach AED and follow prompts
- Request EMS

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Begin High-Performance CPR if no signs of obvious death
- Attach AED and follow prompts
- Request EMS

---

## BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics Start Here

### Adults
- Begin/Continue High-Performance CPR if no signs of obvious death
- Attach AED and follow prompts
- If blunt trauma, and patient is pulseless and apneic: **DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESUSCITATION**
- If penetrating trauma: initiate resuscitation and rendezvous with ALS or no change in condition after 30 minutes and no AED shocks were delivered

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Begin/Continue High-Performance CPR if no signs of obvious death
- Attach AED and follow prompts
- Initiate rapid transport or ALS rendezvous if < 18 years old

---

## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic Only

### Adults
- ABC's
- Monitor/IV
- If Tension Pneumothorax: perform Thoracic Decompression
- If penetrating trauma and does not meet determination of death: initiate immediate transport

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- ABC's
- Monitor/IV
- If Tension Pneumothorax: perform Thoracic Decompression. Reassess patient and provide rapid transport if under 18 years of age

---

## Base Hospital Contact Required

### Adults
- Post ROSC: give 250 mL fluid challenge

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Post ROSC: give 5 mL/kg fluid bolus to maintain Systolic B/P:
  - 1-10 years old: > 70 mmHg
  - 10+ years old: > 80 mmHg

## Special Considerations

### 1. Tension Pneumothorax - Thoracic Decompression
- Tension pneumothorax requires immediate decompression
- **Correct placement for thoracic decompression:**
  - **Pediatric patients:** 2nd intercostal space, mid-clavicular line
  - **Adult patients:** 4th intercostal space, mid-axillary line
- **Approved device:**
  - **Adults:** 10-gauge IV needle with catheter at least 3.25 inches in length
  - **Pediatric:** Standard length 2-inch needle
- Assess patients for return of pulses after decompression
- Evaluate need for fluid challenge

### 2. On-Scene Time Goals
- On-scene times should be **ten minutes or less** for trauma patients that are accessible and do not require prolonged extrication
- Situations that delay on-scene times must be documented in the patient care record
- **On-scene resuscitation is contraindicated in trauma extremis patients**

### 3. Blood Pressure Goals and Fluid Management
- **Goal for blood pressure after fluid challenge:** 80-90 mmHg systolic
  - Higher blood pressure may cause proportionately faster bleeding
  - Lower pressures are not adequate for perfusing the major organs
- **Fluid challenges for traumatic arrest:** Should occur in 250 mL increments

### 4. Termination of Resuscitation
- Termination of resuscitation should be considered in accordance with the Determination of Death policy
