## Public Safety First Aid Procedures

### Adults
- Request EMS
- If Trauma: Control massive bleeding in extremities with Tourniquet. Use Hemostatic gauze to pack Junctions.
- Keep patient warm
- Give oxygen as appropriate

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Request EMS
- If Trauma: Control massive bleeding in extremities with Tourniquet. Use Hemostatic gauze to pack Junctions.
- Keep patient warm
- Give oxygen as appropriate

## BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics Start Here

### Adults
- ABC's
- Is B/P < 90 Systolic with signs of hypoperfusion?
- Give oxygen if SpO2 < 94% or in respiratory distress
- Place the patient in a shock position and keep warm
- Spinal motion restriction as indicated
- Prepare for rapid transport or ALS hand off
- Immobilize fractures enroute
- If Medical: correct Hypoglycemia
- Apply cold pack to site if insect stings are present

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- ABC's
- Is B/P < 90 Systolic with signs of hypoperfusion?
- Give oxygen if SpO2 < 94% or in respiratory distress
- Place the patient in a shock position and keep warm
- Spinal motion restriction as indicated
- Prepare for rapid transport or ALS hand off
- Immobilize fractures enroute
- If Medical: correct Hypoglycemia
- Apply cold pack to site if insect stings are present

## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic Only

### Adults

#### Trauma
- Address treatable causes
- Establish large bore IV/IO
- Consider Tranexamic Acid: 2 gram administered slow IV push

#### Medical
- Give 500 mL fluid bolus to maintain Systolic B/P > 80 mmHg (MAX 30 mL/kg)
- If not responsive to fluids:
  - Give Epinephrine Push Dose 0.5 mL every 1-5 minutes
  - **OR** Epinephrine drip 2-8 mcg/min. Start at 8 mcg/min and titrate down to effect

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)

#### Trauma
- Address treatable causes
- Establish large bore IV/IO

#### Medical
- Give 20 mL/kg fluid bolus to maintain Systolic B/P:
  - 1-10 years old: > 70 mmHg
  - 10+ years old: > 80 mmHg
- If not responsive to fluids:
  - Give Epinephrine Push Dose 0.5 mL every 1-5 minutes
  - **OR** Epinephrine drip 0.1 - 1 mcg/kg/min not to exceed adult dose. Start at the higher end and titrate down to effect

---

## Base Hospital Contact Required

### Adults - Trauma
- Give 250 mL fluid bolus to maintain Systolic B/P > 80 mmHg

### Pediatrics - Trauma
- Give 5 mL/kg fluid bolus to maintain Systolic B/P:
  - 1-10 years old: > 70 mmHg
  - 10+ years old: > 80 mmHg

## Special Considerations

### 1. Signs and Symptoms
- Altered Mental Status
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- Skin pale, cool, diaphoretic, mottled
- Delayed capillary refill
- Weak peripheral pulses
- Narrowed pulse pressure
- Hypotension

### 2. Special Treatment Situations

#### Open Chest Wounds
- Cover with commercially available chest seal
- If signs of tension pneumothorax develop (distended neck veins, cyanosis, tracheal shift, absent breath sounds on one side, falling BP, dyspnea):
  - Remove dressing
  - Allow air to escape
  - Reapply dressing

#### External Hemorrhage Control
Should include (in order):

1. **For exsanguinating hemorrhage:** Go straight to a tourniquet

2. **Direct pressure**

3. **Compression dressings:**
   - Gauze pad and elastic bandage
   - Blood pressure cuff
   - Air splint

4. **Tourniquet for extremity injuries:**
   - Use tourniquet with windlass such as CAT Tourniquet
   - Apply 2-3 inches proximally to the wound
   - May apply a second tourniquet above the first if needed
   - Tighten enough to stop all bleeding
   - Time and date must be written on tourniquet when applied
   - Once applied do not remove until arrival at the hospital
   - Due to possible surgical needs, attempt to transport to a trauma center

5. **Hemostatic gauze dressing or commercially available junctional tourniquet** for uncontrolled junctional hemorrhage:
   - Direct pressure and wound packing should be applied with the hemostatic dressing
   - Use only hemostatic gauze. **DO NOT use granular type hemostatic agents**

### 3. Fluid Challenge in Trauma
Fluid challenge in trauma patients should be avoided due to increased mortality.

### 4. Epinephrine Drip 2-8 mcg/mL Preparation

**Option 1:**
- Begin with a 100 mL bag of normal saline and apply medication label to indicate epinephrine drip
- Obtain 1 ampule or vial of epinephrine 1:1000
- With a 10 mL syringe and a filtered needle, withdraw 0.8 mg of epinephrine 1:1000
- Remove filtered needle, attach hypodermic needle and inject 0.8 mg of epinephrine 1:1000 into a labeled 100 mL saline bag. Shake well
- Attach the 60 drops/mL IV tubing set to the extension set with flow controller (Dial-a-flow). Prime the line and set your desired drops:
  - **2 mcg/min:** Set rate to 15 drops
  - **4 mcg/min:** Set rate to 30 drops
  - **6 mcg/min:** Set rate to 45 drops
  - **8 mcg/min:** Set rate to 60 drops

**Note:** Using 10 drops/mL IV tubing is not recommended for anaphylaxis, bradycardia, or respiratory distress.

### 5. Push Dose Epinephrine

Push Dose epinephrine is 1 mL (0.1 mg) of 1 mg in 10 mL epinephrine (cardiac epinephrine 1:10,000) mixed with 9 mL of N/S resulting in Epinephrine 0.01 mg/mL.

**Preparation:**
- Begin with an empty 10 mL syringe and apply a medication label to indicate push dose epinephrine
- Withdraw 1 mL of 0.1 mg/mL preparation (cardiac epinephrine 1:10,000)
- Withdraw 9 mL of normal saline. Shake well
- Mixture now provides 10 mL of epinephrine at a 10 mcg/mL concentration

**Dosing:**
- Push Dose: 0.5 mL (5 mcg) IV/IO, every 1-5 minutes

### 6. Pain Management
Ketamine should be first-line pain medication for hypotensive patients, or patients at risk for respiratory depression.
