## Public Safety First Aid Procedures

### Adults
- Begin High-Performance CPR
- Attach AED and follow prompts
- Ensure Fire/ALS have been requested

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Begin High-Performance CPR
- Attach AED and follow prompts (use pediatric pads and dose attenuator if available)
- Ensure Fire/ALS have been requested

---

## BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics Start Here

### Adults
- Begin High-Performance CPR
- Attach AED/monitor and follow prompts
- Resume High-Performance CPR immediately post shock
- Pulse checks every 2 minutes for no longer than 10 seconds
- If no change after 30 minutes, consider termination of efforts per determination of death policy

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Begin High-Performance CPR
- Attach AED/monitor and follow prompts (use pediatric pads and dose attenuator if available)
- Resume High-Performance CPR immediately post shock
- Pulse checks every 2 minutes for no longer than 10 seconds
- Request ALS rendezvous. Initiate transport if ALS ETA is greater than 10 min

## ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic Only

### Adults
**For patients < 18 years:** Begin transport after 10 minutes of High-Performance CPR or if ROSC is achieved

- Give 1 shock device specific (see Energy Doses for Defibrillation Chart)
- Pulse/Rhythm checks every 2 minutes for no longer than 10 seconds
- Deliver repeat shocks during rhythm checks, continue High-Performance CPR while defibrillator is charging
- **Lidocaine:** 1-1.5 mg/kg IV/IO first dose, then 0.5-0.75 mg/kg every 5-10 minutes
  - MAX 3 doses or 3 mg/kg
  - The first Lidocaine dose should be given at the 2nd shock
- If a patient is in refractory V-Fib after 3 shocks, begin **Vector Change** pad placement
  - The D-Fib pads will be changed from anterior lateral to anterior posterior (Vector Change)
  - If there is no improvement, consider dual sequential defibrillation if feasible
- **Torsades De Pointes:** Give Magnesium Sulfate 1-2 grams diluted in 10 mL Saline IV/IO
- If no change after 30 minutes, consider termination of efforts per determination of death policy

### Pediatrics (13 years and under)
- Give 1 shock (see Energy Doses for Defibrillation Chart)
- Pulse/Rhythm checks every 2 minutes for no longer than 10 seconds
- Deliver repeat shocks during rhythm checks, continue High-Performance CPR while defibrillator is charging
- **Lidocaine:** 1 mg/kg IV/IO first dose, then 0.5-0.75 mg/kg
  - May repeat dose × 2 in 3-5 minutes with 1 mg/kg for 3 mg/kg MAX
  - The first Lidocaine dose should be given at the 2nd shock
- If a patient is in refractory V-Fib after 3 shocks, begin **Vector Change** pad placement
  - The D-Fib pads will be changed from anterior lateral to anterior posterior (Vector Change)
  - If there is no improvement, consider dual sequential defibrillation if feasible
- **Torsades De Pointes:** Give Magnesium Sulfate 25 mg/kg diluted in 10 mL Saline IV/IO
  - 2 grams MAX dose
  - Given 1 time only

## Base Hospital Contact Required

*(No specific base hospital contact requirements listed)*

## Special Considerations

### 1. Chest Compression Interruptions
Chest compressions should be interrupted only for:
- Ventilation (unless an advanced airway is placed)
- Rhythm checks
- Shock delivery

### 2. Severe Hypothermia (<30°C or <86°F)
- For a cardiac arrest patient in VF/VT with body temperature <30°C (<86°F), a single defibrillation attempt is appropriate
- If the patient fails to respond to the initial defibrillation attempt, defer subsequent attempts and drug therapy until the core temperature rises above 30°C (86°F)
- The hypothermic heart may be unresponsive to drug therapy, defibrillation, and pacemaker therapy
- Drug metabolism is reduced which may allow drug levels to accumulate to toxic levels with standard dosing regimens

### 3. Moderate Hypothermia (30°C to 34°C or 86°F to 93.2°F)
- Attempt defibrillation and give medications spaced at longer intervals

### 4. Priorities During Cardiac Arrest
- High-quality CPR and early defibrillation are the priorities
- Insertion of advanced airway and drug administration are of secondary importance

### 5. Vascular Access Priorities
General priorities for vascular access during resuscitation:
- IV route (first choice)
- IO route (if IV access cannot be established quickly)

**When administering medications by the IV route:**
- Give bolus injection, unless otherwise specified
- Follow with a 10 mL bolus of IV fluid
- Elevate extremity for 10 to 20 seconds to facilitate delivery to central circulation

**Note:** Drugs given by the IV route take 1 to 2 minutes to reach the central circulation.

### 6. Post-Resuscitation Lidocaine Infusion
If Lidocaine was used to convert rhythm, follow with continuous infusion during the post-resuscitation period:
- **Adult:** 1-4 mg/min
- **Pediatric:** 20-50 mcg/kg/min

### 7. Vector Change and Dual Sequential Defibrillation
- If persistent VF/pulseless VT after third defibrillation, begin **Vector Change**
- Vector Change is achieved by changing orientation of pads from **anterior-lateral to anterior-posterior**
- If there is no improvement with Vector Change and persistent VF/pulseless VT, may use **dual sequential defibrillation** by using the pads used in Vector Change with two separate defibrillators
- If persistent or recurrent VF/VT, resuscitation beyond 30 minutes is recommended
