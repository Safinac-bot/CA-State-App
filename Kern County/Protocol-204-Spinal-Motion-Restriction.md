**Effective Date:** 09/01/2020

## Public Safety First Aid Procedures

### Adults and Pediatrics
- Support ABC's
- Request Fire/EMS
- Encourage the patient to remain still if in a safe area/environment

---

## BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics Start Here

### Spinal Assessment

**If a patient is found in setting of significant trauma, perform spinal assessment.**

**Does patient have ANY of the following:**
- Posterior midline vertebral pain, tenderness, or deformity
- Numbness or weakness in any extremity post trauma
- Painful distracting injury
- GCS < 15
- Intoxication
- AGE < 3 or > 65
- Severe head or facial trauma
- Language barrier without reliable translator

**If YES:** Perform spinal motion restriction

---

### Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure

1. **Apply Cervical Collar**

2. **Patient Movement:**
   - If a patient is ambulatory and can safely self-extricate, assist to gurney
   - If extrication is needed: Use a backboard or rigid extrication device to move patients to the gurney
   - **Remove backboard or rigid extrication device once patient is on gurney**

3. **Secure Patient:**
   - Secure patient with seatbelts or straps in supine position
   - Or position of comfort if supine position not tolerated

4. **Isolated Penetrating Trauma:**
   - Do **not** apply Cervical Collar
   - Encourage patient to minimize cervical motion

## Special Considerations

### 1. Implement Spinal Motion Restriction Criteria

**Implement spinal motion restriction in the following circumstances in the setting of significant trauma:**

#### A. Posterior Midline Spinal Pain or Tenderness
With a history of or suspicion of trauma

#### B. Numbness or Weakness
In any extremity after trauma

#### C. Unreliable Exam Including:

1. **Injuries distracting patient from distinguishing spinal pain:**
   - Pelvic fracture
   - Multi-system trauma
   - Crush injury to hands or feet
   - Long bone fracture proximal to the knee/elbow, or to the humerus/femur
   - Severe head or facial trauma, etc.

2. **Penetrating trauma does not require spinal motion restriction unless injury is suspected**

3. **Altered Mental Status:** GCS < 15

4. **Intoxication**

5. **Language barrier,** unless reliable translation is available

6. **Age:** Less than 3 or greater than 65

---

### 2. Examples of Significant Trauma

**Include but are not limited to:**
- MVC > 40 MPH
- MVC rollover and/or ejection
- Fall > 3 feet or 5 stairs
- Axial loading
- Recreational vehicle crash (motorcycles, ATVs, etc.)
- Car vs pedestrian or bicycle
- Vehicle intrusion:
  - > 12 inches to occupant side
  - > 18 inches to any site

---

### 3. Clinical Decision Criteria
Patients who require spinal motion restriction are determined by the criteria listed in Special Consideration #1, **not mechanism of injury alone**.

---

### 4. Penetrating Trauma Exception
Victims of isolated penetrating trauma should **not** have a Cervical Collar applied.

---

### 5. Complete Spinal Motion Restriction Components
Complete spinal motion restrictions include:
- Cervical collar (C-Collar)
- Gurney straps or seatbelts only
- Head blocks may be used to prevent rotation

---

### 6. Backboard/Rigid Extrication Device Use
- Backboard or rigid extrication device shall **not be used for spinal motion restriction**
- **No patient shall be transported on backboard or rigid extrication device** unless removing patient from device interferes with critical treatments or interventions
- **Vacuum splint is acceptable**

---

### 7. Self-Extrication for Neurologically Intact Patients
- If neurologically intact patient can safely self-extricate, assist the patient to the gurney after C-Collar has been applied
- If ambulatory, instruct patients to sit on the gurney
- **Do not use standing takedown on ambulatory patients**
