| **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** | **Public Safety First Aid Procedures: Only** |
| • Request Fire/EMS transport<br>• Support ABC's as needed | • Request Fire/EMS Transport<br>• Support ABC's as needed |
| **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** | **BLS Procedures: EMT's and Paramedics start here** |
| • Assess/support ABC's<br>• Give oxygen only if SpO2 <94% or if in respiratory distress<br>• Rapid transport or ALS Rendezvous | • Assess/support ABC's<br>• Give oxygen only if SpO2 <94% or if in respiratory distress<br>• Rapid transport or ALS Rendezvous |
| **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** | **ALS Prior to Base Hospital Contact: Paramedic only** |
| • Attach monitor/SpO2/Obtain 12 lead ECG<br>• Establish IV<br>• Assess for signs of poor perfusion related to Bradycardia, such as Altered Mental Status, Chest Pain, Shortness of Breath, Hypotension.<br>• If poor perfusion is present, prepare for TRANSCUTANEOUS PACING at a rate of 80 bpm<br>• Consider pain management with 1 mg Midazolam and 50 mcg Fentanyl prior to TCP if Systolic B/P >90<br>• Consider Atropine 0.5 mg IV while preparing pacer. May repeat to a max dose of 3 mg.<br>• Consider Push Dose Epinephrine 0.5 mL every 1-5 minutes OR Epinephrine drip 2-8 mcg/min. Start at 2mcg/min and titrate to effect, if pacing ineffective.<br>• Treat underlying causes and establish base contact | • Attach monitor/SpO2/obtain 12 lead<br>• Bradycardia causing cardio-respiratory compromise?<br>• Establish IV/IO<br>• Under 1 year with heart rate <60 BPM with signs of shock despite oxygenation/ventilation? Perform CPR for 2 minutes, is patient still bradycardic?<br>• If increased vagal tone or primary AV block, give Atropine 0.02 mg/kg minimum dose 0.1 mg BEFORE epinephrine administration. May repeat as needed to max of 1 mg.<br>• Consider Transcutaneous pacing<br>• Consider pain management with Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IM or 0.05 mg/kg IV and 1mcg/kg Fentanyl prior to TCP if over 10 years old Systolic B/P > 90 mmHg or less than 10 years old Systolic B/P > 70 mmHg<br>• Push Dose Epinephrine 0.5 mL every 1-5 minutes OR Epinephrine drip 0.1-1 mcg/kg/min. Start at lower dose and titrate to effect not to exceed adult dose. |

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Primary point of concern is adequacy of perfusion. If patient is hemodynamically stable then monitor and transport patient.

**Key questions to answer:** Are there serious signs and symptoms and if so, are they related to the slow heart rate?

### Serious Signs and Symptoms:

- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Decreased LOC
- Fatigue
- Weak, dizzy, lightheaded
- Syncope
- Hypotension
- CHF
- Ventricular escape rhythms

### 1. Before TCP (Transcutaneous Pacing):

Consider Midazolam and Fentanyl or Morphine, titrated to patient comfort. Contact a base hospital for further orders if additional sedation/pain relief is required.

### 2. Start TCP Immediately If:

- No response to atropine
- Atropine is unlikely to be effective in heart blocks such as second-degree type II or third-degree
- IV access cannot be quickly established
- Patient is severely symptomatic

### 3. After TCP:

- Assess electrical and mechanical capture
- Reassess patient perfusion
- Give analgesics and sedatives for pain control if not done before TCP

### 4. Push Dose Epinephrine Preparation

If patient fails to respond to TCP or ATROPINE consider: Push dose Epinephrine for profoundly hypotensive patients after standard treatments fail to improve blood pressure.

Push Dose epinephrine is 1mL (0.1 mg) of 1 mg in 10 mL epinephrine (cardiac epinephrine 1:10,000) mixed with 9 mL of N/S resulting in Epinephrine 0.01 mg/mL.

**Preparation:**
- Begin with an empty 10mL syringe and apply a medication label to indicate push dose epinephrine.
- Withdraw 1 mL of 0.1 mg/mL preparation (cardiac epinephrine 1:10,000)
- Withdraw 9 mL of normal saline. Shake well.
- Mixture now provides 10 mL of epinephrine at a 10 mcg/mL concentration.
- **Push Dose:** 0.5 mL (5 mcg) IV/IO, every 1-5 minutes.

### 5. TCP Operational Considerations

- Acquire baseline rhythm strip
- Consider premedication with Midazolam for conscious patients
- Apply pacing electrodes to clean, dry, skin
- Set pacer rate at 80
- Activate pacer and adjust current upward until electrical and mechanical capture is identified
- Typical capture thresholds range between 50-90 mA

### 6. Epinephrine Drip Preparation

For long transports consider Epinephrine infusion, titrated to patient response.

**Epinephrine Drip Setup:**
- Begin with a 100mL bag of normal saline and apply medication label to indicate drip.
- Obtain 1 ampule or vial of epinephrine 1:1000
- With a 1 mL syringe and a filtered needle withdraw 0.8mg of epinephrine 1:1000
- Remove filtered needle attach hypodermic needle and inject 0.8mg of epinephrine 1:1000 in labeled 100mL saline bag. Shake well.
- Attach the 60 drops/mL IV tubing set to the extension set with flow controller (Dial-a-flow). Prime the line and set your desired drops, see below for rates.
  - **2mcg/min** set rate to 15 drops
  - **4mcg/min** set rate to 30 drops
  - **6mcg/min** set rate to 45 drops
  - **8mcg/min** set rate to 60 drops
