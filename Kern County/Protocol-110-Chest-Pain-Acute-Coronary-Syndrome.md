## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Chest pain is a possible symptom of ACS. In silent MI's, common in females, elderly, and diabetics, chest pain may not be present. If the patient exhibits signs of ACS without chest pain or the 12 lead reads acute MI, the patient should still be treated appropriately per this protocol.

### 1. 12 Lead ECG Acquisition

Rapidly obtain high quality 12 lead ECG, if STEMI Alert transmit to STEMI receiving center and make base contact to notify of STEMI Alert within 5 minutes of acquisition.

### 2. ECG Documentation

A copy of the ECG should be delivered to the nurse caring for the patient upon arrival at the Emergency Department and a copy must be included in the patient care record.

### 3. STEMI Transport Destination

If patient is having a STEMI and is within 60 minutes of STEMI receiving center see BYPASSING A STEMI REFERRAL (Non-PCI hospital). Patients in the metropolitan Bakersfield area with chest pain/discomfort of suspected cardiac origin should be transported to a cardiac receiving facility.

### 4. Hypoperfusion Management

If acute MI is suspected with signs of hypoperfusion, administer 250 mL fluid challenge. May repeat one time if patient remains hypotensive. Consult with cardiac facility if patient remains hypotensive. Refer to Shock/Hypoperfusion Protocol (125).

### 5. Aspirin Administration

If the patient has not taken aspirin and has no history of aspirin allergy or evidence of recent GI bleeding, administer ASPIRIN (325mg) to chew. Aspirin administration, even if it is prior to patient contact, must be documented.

### 6. Nitroglycerin Administration

Give the patient sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4mg metered dose or gr. 1/150) every 5 minutes for ongoing symptoms, monitor blood pressure and pulse rate between administrations.

**Contraindications:**
- Suspected or known that the patient has taken sildenafil (Viagra) or vardenafil (Levitra) within the previous 24 hours or tadalafil (Cialis) within the previous 48 hours.
- **ALS:** Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or heart rate less than 50 beats per minute.
- **BLS:** Systolic blood pressure is less than 100 mm Hg or heart rate less than 50 beats per minute.
- **BLS:** Not prescribed to patient.

If the patient becomes hypotensive after administration of nitroglycerin, place the patient in shock position. If there is no improvement within 5 minutes, refer to Shock/Hypoperfusion Protocol (125).

### 7. Opioid Pain Management

Administer Fentanyl or Morphine when chest pain/discomfort is unresponsive to nitroglycerin. Give the patient Fentanyl or Morphine to relieve persistent chest pain/discomfort.

**Contraindications:**
- Allergy or hypersensitivity
- Heart rate is less than 50 beats per minute or blood pressure less than 90 systolic
- Respiratory depression

### 8. STEMI Alert Criteria

If the Paramedic believes the patient is suffering an AMI and the 12-lead is not showing "STEMI" the paramedic may call a STEMI receiving center for guidance.
