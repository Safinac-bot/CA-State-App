# Protocol 700-C4-P: Tachycardia with Pulses (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Cardiac Monitor: Confirm rate >220 (Infants) or > 180 (Children)
- ✓ Consider 12-lead-ECG. Transmit as needed for treatment guidance.
- ✓ Treatment (see Table 1)
- ✓ Consider and Treat Causes of Tachycardia (see Table 2)
- ✓ Transport/Contact Base Station

## ALS Treatment

## Table 1: Tachycardia Treatment

| | Stable | Unstable (Narrow) | Unstable (Wide) |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **QRS Complex** | • Narrow (<0.08s)<br>• Wide (>0.08s) | • Narrow (<0.08s) | • Wide (>0.08s) |
| **Perfusion** | • Adequate | • Adequate | • Inadequate |
| **LOC** | • Conscious | • Conscious | • Diminished |
| **Treatment** | • Vagal maneuvers<br>• Consider Adenosine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1st dose: Adenosine rapid 0.1mg/kg IV/IO (max 6mg); if no change after 1-2 min.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2nd dose: Adenosine rapid 0.2mg/kg IV/IO (max 12 mg); if no change after 1-2 min.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Warning:** Do not use if rhythm is irregular, polymorphic or evidence of WPW (see fig 1)<br>• Synch. cardioversion (see Unstable, Wide)<br>• Normal saline bolus 20ml/kg | • Vagal maneuvers<br>• Lidocaine 1mg/kg IVP.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- May repeat once at 0.5-1 mg/kg IVP.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If still no improvement, consider<br>• Sync. cardioversion (see Unstable, Wide) | • Synchronized cardioversion<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Midazolam 0.05-0.1mg/kg IV/IO (max 5mg)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- 0.5-1.0 J/kg;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- if no change 2 J/kg<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Repeat prn |

## Special Considerations

- ✓ Consider and treat possible causes of tachycardia. See Table 2

- ✓ SVT usually occurs in younger patients with HRs greater than 200 bpm.

- ✓ **Typical heart rates for PSVT in infants and children:**
  - ⊘ Infants: 220 to 300/min.
  - ⊘ Children 1-5 years: 200/min.
  - ⊘ Children 5-10 years: 180 to 200/min.

- ✓ Confirm a wide complex tachycardia (QRS >0.08 sec) using multiple leads.

- ✓ **Warning:** Avoid Adenosine in wide complex tachycardia or in suspected WPW (Figure 1)

- ✓ Consult the Base Station if you are unclear about the cause of the dysrhythmia, and if you should treat it.

- ✓ Whenever possible, contact Base Station prior to administering synchronized cardioversion in unstable but conscious patients.

- ✓ In the unstable, unconscious patient where rapid synchronized cardioversion is the highest priority, do not hesitate administering cardioversion before initiating transport and contacting the Base Station.
