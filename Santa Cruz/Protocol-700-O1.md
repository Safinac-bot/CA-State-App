# Protocol 700-O1: Childbirth

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat maternal life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats).

- ✓ Assess. Examine for crowning during contractions. Time the contractions. If baby is crowning and mother feels urge to defecate (push), deliver at scene.

- ✓ If baby is delivered: apply two clamps on cord at 6 and 8 inches from baby. Cut cord between clamps.

- ✓ Assess using the APGAR scoring matrix. Keep the baby warm.

- ✓ Treat neonatal life threats as needed.

- ✓ Prepare for transport / transfer of care

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats in both the mother and neonate. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats).
- ✓ Transport
- ✓ Contact Base Station.

## Special Considerations

- ✓ See Protocol 700-C8-P Neonatal Resuscitation for direction regarding neonatal resuscitation.

- ✓ Remember that patients in their second and third trimester can suffer from supine hypotensive syndrome when lying supine. When possible position these patients in a left lateral position.

### Possible Complications (BLS/ALS):

#### Significant Bleeding (greater than 500cc):
- **Before delivery** - Place mother in left lateral position.
- **After delivery** - Massage fundus of uterus and place baby to breast.
- Track bleeding by applying peripads.

#### Prolapsed Cord
- Place mother in knee-chest position or elevate hips with pillows or folded blankets.
- Insert hand into vagina and attempt to gently push the presenting part upward to release pressure on the cord. Do not damage cord by attempting to push back inside vagina.

#### Nuchal cord:
- Attempt to gently slide umbilical cord over neonate's head. If unable to do so, place mother in knee/chest position and transport. Cutting the cord before the neonate's chest is delivered will cause severe hypoxia and anoxia of the neonate.

#### Breech / Limb Delivery:
- Place mother in left lateral or knee/chest position

#### Eclampsia (Actively Seizing):
- Place mother in left lateral position
- See Protocol 700-N2 Seizure
