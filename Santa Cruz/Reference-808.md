# Reference 808: Core Principles: Managing Trauma

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Rule #1

**Major trauma patients with substantial life threats are not stabilized in the field.**

- Life threatened trauma patients should receive critical prehospital interventions necessary to preserve life, and then be transported expeditiously to the closest, most appropriate, receiving facility, by any transport means necessary.

- **If the field intervention is not critical for managing an immediate life threat, then it should not be done on scene.**

## Rule #2

Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding is the leading cause of potentially preventable death among trauma patients. This is followed by loss of airway patency and unrecognized/untreated chest wall injuries.

## Rule #3

Provide adequate airway control and ventilation; avoid hyperventilation.

- Normoventilation of trauma patients should be the rule in most instances for those trauma patients receiving ventilation. Low CO₂ levels reduce survival rates in most trauma patients.

- Critical trauma patients should, when possible, receive both capnographic and oxygen saturation monitoring, particularly when they are being ventilated.

- Patients with signs of brain herniation (decorticate or decerebrate posturing and/or an asymmetric or non-reactive (blown) pupil) may be modestly hyperventilated (20 breaths/minute in adults) with end-tidal CO₂ levels maintained between 30-35 mmHg.

## Rule #4

Open chest wall injuries should be sealed, symptomatic tension pneumothoracies decompressed.

## Rule #5

Major external hemorrhage should be aggressively controlled using any combination of direct pressure, pressure bandages, and hemostatic gauze.

- The severity of bleeding will dictate the bleeding control intervention.

- Elevating extremities or pinching arterial pressure points to reduce extremity hemorrhage is not effective.

- Large, gaping wounds should be cleared of pooled blood and packed with dressings, and tightly secured. Direct pressure should also be applied.

## Rule #6

Tourniquets should be used to treat life threatening extremity hemorrhage.

## Rule #7

In most cases, fluid resuscitation should be titrated to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg – 100mmHg.

- The concept of low-volume fluid resuscitation avoids the adverse effects of early aggressive resuscitation while maintaining a level of tissue perfusion that, although likely lower than normal, is adequate for short periods.

- Hypotension in the presence of TBI is a very ominous sign. Trauma patients with TBI should be treated with IV fluids to maintain a blood pressure of at least 100 mmHg systolic.

## Rule #8

Reduce heat loss as much as possible and maintain normothermia.

- Hypothermia, defined as a core body temperature below 95°F, is associated with poor outcomes in critical trauma patients.

- **Note:** Patients with injuries requiring tourniquets often have time dependent, complex vascular injuries and may benefit from the level of care only available at a trauma center.

- Tourniquets may also cause permanent nerve and other soft tissue damage. The risk of incurring this permanent damage must be weighed against the benefits of tourniquet application before a tourniquet is applied.

## Rule #9

Be vigilant about ruling out medical causes for traumatic events.

- Trauma patients can have coexistent hypoglycemia, drug overdose, medical cardiac arrest, seizures with a medical etiology. It is critical that altered vital signs and mentation be explored to rule out medical causes for traumatic events.

## Rule #10

Caring for the patient's heart and soul can be as important as managing his or her injuries.

- Numerous studies suggest that trauma patients activate their will to live and their intrinsic resilience when they emotionally connect, however briefly, with their care providers.

- Responders should encourage patients, should communicate their care plan with patients, and should maintain close contact with them throughout evaluation, extrication, treatment, and transport.

## Rule #11

Accurate communication and documentation are critical when managing trauma patients.

## Key Trauma Management Priorities

1. **Critical interventions only** - Don't delay transport
2. **Control bleeding** - Direct pressure, hemostatic gauze, tourniquets
3. **Airway & ventilation** - Avoid hyperventilation (except brain herniation)
4. **Permissive hypotension** - Target SBP 90-100 mmHg (100+ with TBI)
5. **Prevent hypothermia** - Maintain normothermia
6. **Rule out medical causes** - Check glucose, consider overdose, seizures
7. **Patient connection** - Emotional support enhances outcomes

## Ventilation Guidelines

**Normal trauma patients:** 10-12 breaths/min, ETCO₂ 35-45 mmHg

**Brain herniation signs:** 20 breaths/min, ETCO₂ 30-35 mmHg
