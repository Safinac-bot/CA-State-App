**Effective Date:** 8/1/18

## I. Purpose

The goal of EMS resource response and management is to meet the time and resource needs of any medical emergency while still maintaining the integrity of EMS coverage throughout the County.

This policy establishes guidelines for:
- Call response
- Resourcing EMS calls, particularly when the immediate demand for resources outstrips EMS resource availability

---

## II. Core Principles

### A. Incident Command System

EMS calls adhere to the Incident Command System.

**Scene Authority:**
- While law enforcement has ultimate scene authority on all calls
- The incident commander (IC) at most EMS incidents will be the ranking fire officer
- In the absence of this officer on scene, the IC is the highest trained, most senior medical responder

*(see Policy 611: On Scene Medical Control)*

---

### B. Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) System

The Santa Cruz County Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) system in place is helpful in determining:
- The priority of any given EMS call
- The subsequent recommended EMS resource response

---

### C. Appropriate Response

A cavalry EMS response with lights and sirens is often unnecessary and defeats the purpose of a sound call triage system.

---

### D. Flexible and Efficient Systems

EMS systems that are flexible and efficient in their EMS resource response will be:
- Better able to handle surges in requests for response
- More likely to bring the correct EMS resource to the patient's side to affect the best patient disposition

---

## III. Guidelines for EMS Resource Response and Management

### A. Overview

EMS resources – fire apparatus, ambulances, and other first response units - in Santa Cruz County are dispatched according to established EMD criteria.

There are instances, however, when multiple EMS calls occur simultaneously, requiring responding units to alter their call destinations to:
- Optimize EMS call coverage
- Provide the timeliest response to the highest acuity patient

**This policy helps to guide EMS response diversion within the incident command system.**

---

### B. Procedure

#### 1. Resource Commitment
If a fire or ambulance resource has been committed to an incident, it shall remain committed to that incident until it has completed the call **or if one of the following conditions has been met:**

#### 2. Enroute Diversion to Higher Priority Call
If fire and ambulance units are enroute to a call, and another, higher priority call occurs in the units' response area, one or both units may divert to the higher priority call.

#### 3. On-Scene Unit with Diverted Incoming Resource

If a fire or ambulance unit is at the scene of a call and the second incoming EMS unit is diverted to another call:
- NetCom shall advise the on-scene unit of this diversion
- Provide the location/ETA of the next closest EMS unit
- The IC may, at this point, declare the call **"non-divertible"**

**Should this occur:**
- NetCom will direct the original incoming EMS resource to continue to the initial call
- Will dispatch another EMS resource to the second incident

#### 4. Criteria for Non-Diversion

**Criteria for non-diversion include the following:**

##### a) Patient in Extremis
The patient at the original incident is in extremis or near in extremis.

##### b) Time-Dependent Emergency
The patient at the original incident has a substantially time dependent clinical emergency that:
- Cannot be managed on scene
- Further delays to definitive care worsening the patient's chances for survival or reduced morbidity

---

### C. Fire Unit Diversion from Status IV-V Patient

If a fire unit is at the scene with a **Status IV-V** (see Policy 621 Patient Acuity Guidelines) patient requiring no further treatment other than transport, this unit may leave the patient to respond to another pending call **under the following conditions:**

#### 1. Time-Dependent Pending Call
This pending call requires a time dependent response (e.g.):
- Structure fire
- Cliff rescue
- Confirmed vehicle accident with injuries
- High priority medical call with credible RP information

#### 2. No Other Closer Resource
There is no other fire or ambulance unit in close enough proximity to handle the pending call in a reasonable time frame.

#### 3. Patient Condition and Notification
The patient has:
- No identifiable need for immediate, continued treatment
- Been informed that another EMS unit is coming to his/her location
- Will also be prompted to call 911 back if his/her status worsens

#### 4. Coordination
The new incoming EMS resources and Net Com are aware of:
- The diversion
- The location of the patient waiting for transport

---

### D. Documentation for Diverted Calls

Given the time dependent nature of this resource diversion:
- **No AMA/RAS paperwork needs to be completed at scene**
- The ambulance copy of the TOC, if filled out, should be left with the patient for the incoming transport unit

**After the higher priority response has been completed:**
- EMS responders should document their initial evaluation and care of the first patient encountered

---

### E. Fire Unit Clearing Scene (Status IV-V Patient)

If a fire unit is at the scene with a Status IV-V patient requiring no treatment other than transport, this unit may leave the patient and become available for response.

**This decision should be based on:**
- The patient's complaints
- Scene safety considerations
- Stability of the patient's vital signs and physiologic status
- Proximity and reliability of the incoming transport resource

**Documentation:**
- In this instance, a release at scene (RAS) should be completed, if possible
- However, if the patient is not in agreement with the fire resource clearing the scene, this resource may still clear if appropriate documentation backs up this decision
- This decision shall be documented in:
  - The patient care record
  - The operational report for the call

---

### F. Single Resource Response and Call Queuing

Fire and ambulance resources may be used as single response resources to triage low priority calls in the system, particularly when the system is experiencing high resource demand.

**Call Queuing:**
- In addition, NetCom may queue non-emergent Priority A calls for up to one hour if transport resources drop below coverage limits that would safely allow for County-wide response to high priority, time dependent calls
- The criteria for delaying response to calls should be developed by local approved EMS providers in partnership with County EMS and NetCom

---

### G. Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) or Prolonged Disaster

A mass casualty incident (MCI) or prolonged disaster can quickly drain County first response and transport resources.

**In the event of an MCI or disaster:**
- First responder and transport command staff will coordinate area resource use to most efficiently manage these incidents

**This could include:**
- Utilizing non-traditional transport vehicles (mass transit, etc.) to transport victims to appropriate medical destinations
- Use of non-traditional field medical stations
- And the like

---

### H. System Response During MCI or Disaster

An MCI or disaster can also greatly reduce the ability of the EMS system to respond to other emergent and non-emergent calls occurring in the system.

**Should this occur:**
- Resource response to higher priority (B – E) calls can also be amended by fire and transport command staff in coordination with NetCom

**In these instances:**
- Response to these higher priority calls may be delayed or cancelled completely
- Single resource response may also be utilized to manage these calls
