# Procedure 709: Pediatric Fast Packs

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Purpose:

⊘ Critically ill and injured pediatric patients occur infrequently in pre-hospital EMS. They constitute a high hazard, low frequency event in the field. These calls require EMS crews to perform rapid assessments and provide timely critical interventions. These tasks are complicated by the varying statures and weights of children which require crews to quickly size equipment, and compute drug dosages and defibrillation settings.

⊘ The Pediatric Fast Pack (PFP) has been designed to assist EMS crews in providing accurate BLS and ALS care to children utilizing a length-based system that incorporates all Santa Cruz County EMS pediatric policies and protocols.

## Indications / Requirements

⊘ The PFP may be used on all relevant pediatric calls. It is a mandated piece of prehospital equipment, and as such, will be carried by all frontline ALS ambulances and fire apparatus in the County. While its use is highly encouraged, crews may also utilize other computation and measurement methods for arriving at correct equipment sizing, drug dosing, and defibrillation/cardioversion settings.

⊘ The PFP uses accepted numerical rounding techniques for some small volume drug dosages on low weight patients. These have been approved by the Santa Cruz County EMS Medical Director.

## Contraindications:

⊘ None.

## Procedure

⊘ Size the patient using the Pediatric Fast Pack Tape.

⊘ Establish the child's weight in kilograms and choose the correct colored divider.

⊘ Refer to the enclosed protocol-based reference cards and airway adjuncts as appropriate.

⊘ Utilize other equipment-BVMs, OB Kits, etc.-found in the Pack's side pouches and other sub-compartments as needed.

⊘ EZ-IO, medications, and other medical supplies will be carried in separate carry-on bags/cases.

## Documentation

⊘ Paramedics should document use of the Pediatric Fast Pack in their PCRs when appropriate. (example: "Drug dosing was arrived at using the Pediatric Fast Pack.")

## Training/QA

⊘ All paramedics using the Pediatric Fast Pack will complete a County-approved training program and will review its use at the annual mandatory skills review required for continued paramedic accreditation.
