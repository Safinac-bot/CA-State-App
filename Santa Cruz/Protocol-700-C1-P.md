# Protocol 700-C1-P: Cardiac Arrest (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Confirm DNR Status
- ✓ CPR per current County guidelines. Minimize delays and interruptions
- ✓ Apply AED and use as indicated
- ✓ Prepare for transport/transfer of care.

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Cardiac Monitor and determine rhythm
- ✓ **Identify possible causes***
  - ⊘ Treat according to Table 1
  - ⊘ Known dialysis patients with possible hyperkalemia
    - Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV/IO
    - Calcium Chloride 20 mg/kg IV/IO.
  - ⊘ Penetrating Chest Trauma
    - Consider Tension Pneumothorax (see Procedure 702 Pleural Decompression)

- ✓ **If ROSC achieved:**
  - ⊘ Maintain SpO₂ ≥ 95% using lowest concentration of O₂ possible
  - ⊘ Ventilate to achieve an end tidal CO₂ of 35 – 45 mmHg
    - **Warning: Avoid hyperventilation**
  - ⊘ Maintain SBP ≥ 90 mmHg.
    - IV fluids, Normal saline 20 cc/kg bolus
    - Push-dose Epinephrine 0.1 ml/kg (1 mcg/kg) very slow IV/IO every 3-5 minutes prn SBP < 90. See Procedure 708 Push-dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions
      - • Titrate to maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
      - • For patients ≥ 5 kg, standard adult doses of 0.5 ml (5 mcg) will apply
  - ⊘ Manage post-arrest arrhythmias as needed.
  - ⊘ Obtain a 12 lead ECG and transmit as indicated. Crews in South County should contact Dominican Hospital before transporting a post-arrest STEMI patient north as transport to Watsonville Community Hospital may be more appropriate.

- ✓ Consider transporting hypothermic, drug-overdosed, or electrocuted patients.

## Table 1: Treatment by Rhythm

### Asystole

- ✓ **Epinephrine**
  - ⊘ (1:10,000) 0.01mg/kg IVP/IO
  - ⊘ Repeat q3-5 minutes for duration of arrest.
- ✓ **Consider Normal saline**
  - ⊘ 20 ml/kg fluid challenge.
  - ⊘ May repeat as indicated.
- ✓ **If no response** consider termination of resuscitative efforts (see Policy 613, Determination of Death in the Field)

### Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA)

- ✓ **Epinephrine**
  - ⊘ (1:10,000) 0.01mg/kg IVP/IO
  - ⊘ Repeat q3-5 minutes for duration of arrest.
- ✓ **Consider Normal saline**
  - ⊘ 20 ml/kg fluid challenge.
  - ⊘ May repeat as indicated.
- ✓ **If electrical HR <40 BPM** due to blunt trauma, consider determination of death prior to initiating resuscitation (see Policy 613, Determination of Death in the Field)

### Ventricular Fibrillation or Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia

- ✓ **Defibrillate ASAP**
- ✓ **Epinephrine**
  - ⊘ (1:10,000) 0.01mg/kg IVP/IO
  - ⊘ Repeat q3-5 min
- ✓ **Defibrillate at max. joules** as above after 5 cycles of CPR
  - ⊘ Start at 2 joules/kg then 4 joules/kg
  - ⊘ Defibrillate after each medication throughout the arrest
- ✓ **Amiodarone**
  - ⊘ 5mg/kg mg IVP/IO
- ✓ **If return to supraventricular rhythm, consider:**
  - ⊘ Normal saline 250ml bolus

## Documentation

- ✓ Cardiac Arrest is a System Quality Indicator (See Policy 101 Quality Improvement Program and System Evaluation and Policy 502 Santa Cruz County Patient Care Record (PCR) and Transfer of Care Document)

- ✓ **Minimum documentation elements include:**
  - Bystander CPR (PUB-1)
  - AED prior to arrival (CAR-1)
  - First Arrival time to rescuer CPR
  - Initial rhythm recorded
  - EtCO₂ readings (initial and continuous)
  - Defibrillation (number and dose)
  - Intubation (see #6)
  - ROSC (y/n) (CAR-2)
  - Survival to ED discharge (CAR-3)
  - Survival to hospital discharge (CAR-4)
