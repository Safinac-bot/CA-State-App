## I. General Requirements

### A. Patient Care Record Completion

A patient care record shall be completed on every EMS response for all phases of prehospital care.

### 1. Regulatory Requirements

The California Code of Regulations Title 22, Section 100175 (A) (6) specifies the requirements for the initiation, completion, review, evaluation and retention of a patient care record.

#### a) Legal Medical Record
The PCR is the permanent legal medical record that documents all aspects of prehospital care or refusal of care.

#### b) Patient Information Transfer
The PCR provides pertinent patient information to other health care providers regarding patient presentation and field care provided.

#### c) Quality Improvement
In Santa Cruz County, PCRs also serve as the basis for retrospective quality improvement.

---

### 2. Electronic Documentation Requirements

All prehospital patient care data as listed below shall be recorded electronically in an approved format:

#### a) BLS and ALS First Responder

#### b) BLS, ALS and CCT Transports

#### c) Against Medical Advice (AMA) or Release at Scene (RAS) Forms

#### d) "Dry Run" PCRs
"Dry run" PCRs that do not result in a patient contact.

**Patient Contact Definition:**
- A patient contact is defined as any prehospital provider offer of assistance or care to a person with a medical complaint or the suspicion of a medical/traumatic complaint.

#### e) Separate PCR Requirement
A separate PCR must be completed for every patient contact.

---

## II. Documentation Requirements

### A. Transfer of Care Documentation (TOC)

#### 1. Purpose
The TOC is the preliminary patient care report that is critical for ensuring an informed continuum of care for all patients transported from the field.

#### 2. Critical Information
Critical first responder information such as:
- Brief history of present illness
- Physical exam
- Vital signs
- Medications administered
- Procedures performed

Shall be recorded and reported to the transporting providers prior to patient arrival at the hospital.

#### 3. Documentation Priority
Documentation responsibilities should never take precedence over hands-on rescue and patient care and therefore may not always be possible to complete during an incident. Nevertheless, prehospital information, particularly for critical patients, is essential for the Emergency Department and Hospital course of care and every effort to relay this information should be made.

---

### a) eTOC (ImageTrend)

#### (1) Electronic Transfer Requirements
Critical first responder data elements are recorded, electronically transferred to the transporting unit, and posted to the destination hospital **within 10 minutes of patient departure from the scene**.

---

### b) Paper TOC

#### (1) Backup Use Only
A Transfer of Care paper form shall only be used as a backup during:
- System downtime
- Equipment failures
- Temporary loss of internet connectivity

#### (2) Delivery Method
This document shall be handed directly to the transporting crew and in turn delivered to the Emergency Department care team.

#### (3) Documentation
Transport personnel will take a photo of the TOC and attach image file to the PCR.
