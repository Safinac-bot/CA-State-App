# Protocol 700-M6: Sepsis

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Prepare for transport/transfer of care. Be sure to notify ALS responders of your suspicion for sepsis

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)

- ✓ Check blood sugar. BG >140 mg/dl in a non-diabetic patient may be a sign of sepsis. Less commonly, hypoglycemia can occur with overwhelming sepsis. Treat per Protocol 700-M7 Diabetic Emergencies.

- ✓ Check ETCO₂. ETCO₂ <25 mmHg is associated with sepsis.

- ✓ Transport and contact hospital with sepsis alert

- ✓ Maintain SAO₂ at 95% or greater

- ✓ **Treat Shock**
  - ⊘ Up to 30 ml/kg Normal saline with signs and symptoms of severe sepsis or septic shock.
    - Use cautiously in patients with structural heart disease (cardiomyopathy, severe valvular disease, etc.) or CHF. Administer in 10ml/kg boluses, repeating as indicated if the patient shows no signs of fluid overload (pulmonary edema, hypertension).
    - Profound hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation
      - Push-dose Epinephrine 0.5 ml (5 mcg) very slow IV/IO every 3-5 minutes prn SBP < 90. See Procedure 708 Push-dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions

- ✓ Report and handoff at the receiving hospital should include all history and physical exam information, including that the patient has "suspected sepsis."

## Special Considerations

### Sepsis Evaluation

- ⊘ Gather accurate patient information including risk factors for sepsis:

### Sepsis Risk Factors
- >70 years of age
- History of diabetes
- Recent hospitalization or living at a SNF
- Recent surgery or invasive procedure
- Hx of cancer, kidney disease, malnutrition, alcoholism, other immune compromising diseases

### Sepsis Criteria

**Vital Signs (Any 2)**
- Heart rate >90
- Respiratory rate >20
- Temp >100.4 or < 96.0

**Signs and Symptoms (Any 2)**
- SOB, tachypnea, cough
- Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea
- Skin infection
- General weakness, lethargy, ALOC, esp. in the elderly
- Current infection diagnosis
- Urinary pain, urinary frequency, flank pain

---

**Note:** The single most important element of the prehospital management of sepsis is recognizing that a patient might be septic and communicating this information to other responders and the receiving hospital as soon as possible.
