# Procedure 702: Pleural Decompression

**Revision 7/9/20 Effective 8/1/20**

## Indications:

⊘ When clinical findings reveal a tension pneumothorax (severe respiratory distress, diminished breath sounds on the affected side, tracheal deviation) with rapidly deteriorating vital signs.

⊘ Situations that raise suspicion for a tension pneumothorax are penetrating trauma, particularly to the chest or upper abdomen.

⊘ **Respiratory and cardiovascular findings may include the following:**

- **Respiratory distress** (considered a universal finding) or respiratory arrest.

- **Tachypnea** (or bradypnea as a preterminal event).

- **Asymmetric lung expansion** - A mediastinal and tracheal shift to the contralateral side can occur with a large tension pneumothorax.

- **Distant or absent breath sounds** - Unilaterally decreased or absent lung sounds is a common finding, but decreased air entry may be absent even in an advanced state of the disease.

- **Tachycardia** - This is the most common finding. If the heart rate is faster than 135 beats/min, tension pneumothorax is likely.

- **Hypotension** - This should be considered as an inconsistently present finding; although hypotension is typically considered a key sign of a tension pneumothorax, studies suggest that hypotension can be delayed until its appearance immediately precedes cardiovascular collapse.

- **Jugular venous distention** - This is generally seen in tension pneumothorax, although it may be absent if hypotension is severe

## Equipment:

⊘ Pleural decompression kit.

⊘ Chlorhexidine swab.

⊘ 3 1/4-inch, 10 -14 gauge angiocath.

## Procedure:

⊘ **Approved Sites:**
- 2nd to 3rd intercostal space, mid-clavicular line.

⊘ Prep site with chlorhexidine.

⊘ Firmly but carefully insert the needle at a 90-degree angle just over the superior aspect (superior border) of the rib, through the skin and pleura until air escapes or a distinct "give" is felt.
- The undersurface of the rib should be avoided to limit injury to the neurovascular bundle.
- Air should be freely aspirated (if not, you are not in the pleural space).

⊘ Remove the needle.

⊘ Attach a one-way valve. Secure with tape.

⊘ Recheck breath sounds and continuously monitor cardio-respiratory status.

## Complications:

⊘ lung laceration.

⊘ pneumothorax.

⊘ hemorrhage secondary to damage to the intercostal artery or vein
