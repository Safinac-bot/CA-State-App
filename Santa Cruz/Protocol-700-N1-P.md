# Protocol 700-N1-P: Altered Mental Status (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Spinal precautions as indicated.
- ✓ Consider causes*
- ✓ If unconscious, place a dime size amount of Glucose Paste under the tongue.
- ✓ If pt. can swallow on command, administer Glucose Paste or let patient self-administer glucose product.
- ✓ Prepare for transport/transfer of care.

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats).

- ✓ **Check for Hypoglycemia**
  - ⊘ Perform Blood Glucose check
    - if less than 60 mg/dl treat as needed.
      - **If conscious**
        - • consider giving Glucose PO.
      - **If unconscious or unable to take oral sugar**
        - • Dextrose 10% 5ml/kg IV up to 250 ml. Titrate to clinical response. Following initial infusion, check level of consciousness and BG Chem.

  - ⊘ If BG < 60 and the patient still has altered mentation, consider repeating Dextrose 10% 5ml/kg 250 ml.
    - Recheck patency of IV line frequently.

  - ⊘ If no IV can be established and patient presents with altered mentation, consider Glucagon
    - < 20 kg, give 0.5 units (0.5mg) IM
    - ≥ 20 kg, give 1 unit (1mg) IM

- ✓ Transport/Contact Base Station.
  - ⊘ Repeat BG check end-route

## *Causes of Altered Mental Status

**AEIOU TIPS**

- **A** - Alcohol
- **E** - Epilepsy with seizure activity
- **I** - Infection
- **O** - Overdose
- **U** - Uremia (renal failure)
- **T** - Trauma
- **I** - Insulin (high or low BSL)
- **P** - Poisoning
- **S** - Stroke

## Special Considerations

- ✓ If the patient's history of present illness/clinical presentation suggests acute hypoglycemia, give sugar even if the blood sugar reading is in the "low normal" range (60-80mg/dl).

- ✓ Mental status improvement following treatment for hypoglycemia may lag behind improved glucose levels.

- ✓ Oral glucose is the preferred treatment for hypoglycemia when the patient can take medication orally.

- ✓ Insulin pumps administer very small quantities of insulin at any one time. Insulin pumps should not be discontinued when treating hypoglycemia.

- ✓ Glucagon often causes nausea and vomiting. (See Protocol 700-M4-P Nausea and Vomiting)

- ✓ Glucagon may take 10–15 minutes or longer to increase glucose levels.

- ✓ Wait at least 15 minutes to recheck glucose before considering additional therapy.

- ✓ Acute hypoglycemia can occur with renal failure, starvation, alcohol intoxication, sepsis, Aspirin overdoses, sulfa drug ingestion or following bariatric surgery.
