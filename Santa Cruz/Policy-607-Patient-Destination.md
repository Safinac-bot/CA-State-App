## I. Non-Immediate Medical Emergencies

### A. Patient Choice of Destination

If a patient's nature of illness does not place him in any immediate life threat, as judged by:
- A paramedic
- Base Station Physician, **OR**
- Mobile Intensive Care Nurse (MICN)

The patient or person legally responsible for the patient or a contacted family physician, may designate the destination hospital.

**The request shall be honored unless the requested destination hospital cannot accept and diverts the patient to another hospital.**

---

### Patient Without Hospital Preference

If the patient does not wish to designate a hospital, the patient is to be advised by the paramedic of the hospital to which he/she is to be taken.

---

### Diversion Outside Santa Cruz County

Any diversion of an ambulance to a Hospital other than one in Santa Cruz County will be at the discretion of the paramedic supervisor.

---

### Multi-Casualty Incident (MCI)

In the case of an MCI event, the designated transportation officer, in conjunction with medical control, shall determine:
- The most appropriate facility, **AND**
- Transport method

---

## II. Alternate Destination

### A. Patient Identification and Triage

Those patients who are eligible to be considered for an Alternate Destination will be identified upon their request for Emergency Medical Services.

**Responsibility:**
- Those paramedics and EMTs that have been pre-designated by county EMS will be responsible for the appropriate triage of these patients
- Should the patient meet the pre-determined criteria for the alternate destination program, the paramedic will be responsible for facilitating the transportation of the patient to the appropriate destination as designated by the county

---

### B. Transport Changes

#### Change During Transport
If at any time during transport the patient presentation changes or the paramedic feels it necessary to transport the patient to the ED:
- The paramedic may do so
- Must contact the ED as soon as possible via radio or cell phone

#### Patient Requests ED After Clinic Designation
In cases where the patient asks to go to the ED after the paramedic has identified the patient as appropriate for the clinic:
- The paramedic should consider discussing the criteria by which the transport decision was made
- If an agreement cannot be reached, the paramedic will transport the patient to the ED

---

## III. Immediate Life-Threatening Medical Emergencies

### A. Critical Patient Transport

A patient who is considered by the paramedic, Base Station Physician, or MICN, to be in an immediate life-threatening condition, and where immediate attendance by a physician is urgent to the survival of the patient, shall be transported to:

**"The most accessible emergency medical facility, staffed and prepared to administer care appropriate to the needs of the patient"**

*(Ref. Section 1105(c), Title 13, California Administrative Code, i.e., Ambulance Regulations)*

---

### B. Transportation Factors

It is recognized that in many cases the closest hospital, as measured by geographic distance, is not necessarily the hospital that can be accessed in the shortest time.

**It is essential that paramedics and EMTs take the following transportation factors into consideration when determining hospital destination:**

#### 1. Time of Day and Day of Week

#### 2. Current Traffic Patterns
Current traffic patterns which may cause delay of transport

---

### C. Specialty Center Direct Transport

If a patient meets specialty center destination criteria for direct transport from the field, the receiving hospital will function as a Base Hospital should consultation be necessary for that patient.

---

### D. Base Hospital Notification and Approval

**Paramedics and EMTs are to advise the paramedic Base Hospital of the intended destination hospital.**

**Responsibilities:**
- It is the responsibility of the Base Hospital Physician/MICN to approve, confirm, or redirect the ultimate destination hospital for patients who are in extremis
- It will be the MICN's responsibility to notify the receiving hospital by phone of patients being transferred to their facility

---

## IV. Pediatric

### A. Critically Ill or Injured Child

#### 1. Transport to EDAP

Paramedics and EMTs will transport critically ill or injured children to the most accessible and appropriate EDAP.

**Direct Transport to Specialty Centers:**
- Transport from the scene directly to a PICU/Trauma Center/Burn Center will be limited to those cases when distance or delay are critical factors to a patient's outcome
- EMS personnel will follow **Policy #606 (Policy for Air Ambulance)** when requesting a medical helicopter response

#### 2. Parent/Guardian Requests for Distant Hospital

Requests by a parent or person legally responsible for the child requesting transport of a critical child to a more distant EDAP or non-EDAP hospital should be advised verbally of the potential medical consequence.

#### 3. Base Hospital Consultation

Consider contacting a Base Hospital for advice and direction as the situation warrants.

**If the parent or legal guardian continues to insist on by-passing the most accessible and appropriate EDAP/hospital:**
- Paramedics and EMTs will request that an Against Medical Advice (AMA) form be signed

---

### B. Non-Critical Child

#### 1. Standard Transport

All children entering the EMS system who require ambulance transport, but are not critically ill or injured, will be transported to the most accessible and appropriate EDAP.

#### 2. Family Request for Alternative Destination

Requests by family, or person legally responsible for the child, for transport of a non-critical child to:
- A more distant EDAP, **OR**
- A non-EDAP hospital

**Will be honored.**

---

## V. Dispute Resolution

### A. Base Hospital Physician Final Authority

In any dispute, the Base Hospital Physician, in direct voice contact with the paramedic, will make the **final decision** as to whether:
- The patient is in immediate life threat, **AND**
- Whether the patient is to be transported to:
  - The closest accessible acute care hospital emergency department, **OR**
  - The hospital which the patient or family or primary care physician wishes

**The paramedics and EMTs may NOT override the decision of the Base Hospital Physician once made.**
