# Reference 806: Core Principles: Managing Cardiac Arrest

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 800: Reference Materials

## Rule #1

The initial emphasis in managing cardiac arrest patients is in establishing circulation via high quality, uninterrupted chest compressions.

- During the resuscitation attempt no pauses of greater than 5 seconds should ever occur, if possible.
- 100 compressions/minute with full recoil
- Switch compressors every 2 minutes when possible

## Rule #2

Defibrillation should be attempted as soon as possible during the resuscitation.

- Patients who develop ventricular defibrillation while being monitored may be immediately defibrillated. "Off the chest" time should only occur during the actual defibrillation of the patient.

## Rule #3

Continuous compressions and defibrillation are more important than ventilation, vascular access, and medications.

## Rule #4

Modest, interpolated ventilation should be administered on every 10th compression upstroke.

- Choice of adjuncts for ventilation should be based on the specific needs of the patient. Endotracheal intubation is still the optimal airway, especially if a ROSC is achieved.

## Rule #5

Vascular access may be established via either IV or IO routes.

- IV routes provide more versatility and ease of use once established.

## Rule #6

Medication administration should proceed per protocol.

- Epinephrine mildly enhances CPR
- Antiarrhythmics are effective once ROSC is achieved.

## Rule #7

Ventilating patients, placing advanced airways, and establishing vascular access should not interfere with continuous chest compressions or defibrillation.

## Rule #8

End-tidal capnography should be used for evaluating the effectiveness of resuscitation, the return of pulses, and as an endpoint for the resuscitation attempt.

## Rule #9

A team leader should clearly be identified at the beginning of the resuscitation attempt. All cardiac arrest management should be handled in a sequential and orderly fashion, with all job tasks clearly defined and delegated to resuscitation team members.

- Overall scene management should be coordinated and supervised using the precepts of the Incident Command System.

## Rule #10

Post-arrest management should focus on stabilizing the patient's life threats and transport. This management should include the following:

- Maintain O₂ saturations (SpO₂) above 94% using the lowest concentration of O₂ possible. Ventilation on room air is optimal if saturations can be maintained.

- Ventilate the patient 10-12 breaths per minute to achieve an end tidal CO₂ of 35 – 45 mmHg. **No hyperventilation!**

- Maintain a minimum systolic BP of 90 mmHg. Use IV fluids and Push-dose Epinephrine to achieve this. If the patient's BP is 90 systolic or higher, there is no need for any further circulatory support. See Procedure 708 Push-Dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions

- Manage post-arrest arrhythmias as needed.

- Obtain a 12 lead ECG. Transmit/transport to Dominican Hospital if a STEMI is identified. If the call occurs in South County, make base station contact with Dominican Hospital prior to transport.

## Rule #11

Resuscitation should not be attempted, or continued, in circumstances that are patently futile.

## "Pit Crew" Cardiac Arrest Sequence of Care

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Step 1** | Scene safety and universal precautions |
| **Step 2** | Determine unresponsiveness (no more than 5 seconds) |
| **Step 3** | Begin chest compressions @ 100 compressions/minute |
| **Step 4** | Attach EKG quick patches, turn on EKG monitor, evaluate rhythm and defibrillate as indicated. |
| **Step 5** | BVM/ETI/LTD at 1 every 6 seconds, ventilating during every 10th compression upstroke. |
| **Step 6** | Do not stop compressions for more than 2-4 seconds to deploy an airway adjunct. |
| **Step 7** | Establish vascular access. If venous access is not easily established, establish IO access. |
| **Step 8** | Administer drug therapy in accordance with the appropriate protocol. |
| **Step 9** | Switch compressors every 2 minutes, avoiding interruptions > 2-4 seconds. During this pause, check the ECG to determine if defibrillation is indicated. If so, defibrillate. |
| **Step 10** | ROSC? Stop CPR and continue to ventilate 10-12/min (adult) or 20/min (peds). Follow post-arrest instructions above |
