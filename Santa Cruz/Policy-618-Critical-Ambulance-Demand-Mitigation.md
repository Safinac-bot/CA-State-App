**Revision Date:** 5/22/18  
**Effective Date:** 8/1/18  
**EMS Medical Director:** David Ghilarducci, MD

---

## I. Purpose and General Principles

### A. Intent
The following plan is intended to address unanticipated requests for 911 ambulance services by providing a progression of mitigating steps to ensure that:
- Capacity to respond is maximized
- Scarce ambulance resources are allocated to the best possible use

### B. Step-Wise Approach
Each phase represents a step-wise approach triggered by worsening levels of system status.

**Generally, it would be inappropriate to implement Phase II steps before all Phase I steps have been attempted, for example.**

### C. Resource Management Focus
This document is intended for resource management, **not** for specific incident management such as an MCI.

### D. Implementation Authorization
Implementation of this plan does **not** require pre-authorization by the Santa Cruz County EMS Agency and real time notification of the EMS Administrator and EMS Medical Director is required.

### E. Unanticipated Events Only
This plan is **not** intended for mitigation of anticipated events such as:
- Special events
- Severe weather
- Sick leave
- Strikes

Which shall be addressed proactively by the 911 ambulance agency.
