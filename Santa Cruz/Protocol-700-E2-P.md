| **Temperature** | • 82-90°F, 28-32°C | • <86°F, <30°C |
| **Neurological** | • No Shivering<br>• Decreased LOC | • "Rigor mortis" muscle tone<br>• Apneic<br>• Comatose |
| **Cardiovascular** | • Atrial Fib or Bradycardia | • V. fib or asystole |
| **Other Signs** | • Hypoventilation<br>• Dilated or Fixed pupils<br>• Bright Pink to Pale Skin | • Dilated/fixed pupils<br>• Skin edema/Swollen face<br>• Osborne Waves on ECG |

## Special Considerations

- ✓ If patient is pulseless, consider a single counter shock at 1J/kg and a single round of drugs. Do not repeat. Generally, avoid IV medications (excluding warmed saline) when in severe hypothermia.

- ✓ Avoid rough movement and excess activity. Stimulation of the patient could significantly cause deterioration of vital signs.
