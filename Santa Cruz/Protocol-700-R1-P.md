# Protocol 700-R1-P: Respiratory Distress (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Place patient in position of comfort.
- ✓ Observe for signs of severe respiratory distress (Table 1)
  - ⊘ Epinephrine Auto-injector (See Procedure 715 Epinephrine Auto-Injector)
    - For draw and inject Epinephrine see Special Considerations below
- ✓ Keep patient and family calm.
  - ⊘ Remember to keep the child in the lap of a caregiver whenever possible on scene. This will keep the child calmer, help to prevent further worsening of symptoms, and allow for better evaluation of the child's respiratory status.
- ✓ Prepare for transport/transfer of care.

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Cardiac Monitor and determine rhythm
- ✓ Obtain baseline SpO₂ on room air or baseline O₂ usage
  - ⊘ Titrate O₂ to main SpO₂ above 94%
- ✓ If child presents with symptoms consistent with croup (history of upper respiratory infection, fever, "seal bark" cough, or stridor) consider blow by nebulized NS to cool inflamed subglottic tissues.
- ✓ Consider CPAP if ≥ 8 years old
- ✓ Treat in accordance with suspected condition (Table 2)
- ✓ Transport/Contact Base Station.

## Table 1: Signs of Severe Respiratory Distress

- ALOC
- Sig. accessory muscle use
- fatigue
- low SpO₂
- poor skin signs
- Elevated ETCO₂
- inability to speak

---

## Special Considerations

- ✓ An increased work of breathing - typified by retractions, grunting, head bobbing, and nasal flaring is the most specific indicator of respiratory distress.

- ✓ Fatigue is the most specific indicator for impending respiratory failure.

- ✓ Respiratory failure is the number one cause of pediatric cardiac arrest. Bradycardia is almost always caused by hypoxia in children and is an ominous and late finding.

- ✓ EMTs accredited for Optional Scope of Practice per Policy 208 EMS Responder Scope of Practice may draw and inject epinephrine in accordance with ALS procedures

## Table 2: Treatment Protocols for Respiratory Distress

### Suspected Croup (Stridor)
- Normal saline via nebulizer

### Bronchospasm (Diffuse Wheezing)
- Albuterol: 2.5 mg via nebulizer
- Repeat Albuterol as needed
- Obtain base contact if HR >180
- If the patient is in severe distress and his/her tidal volume decreased,
  - administer Albuterol via in-line CPAP or BVM
- If, after all other interventions, the patient's condition remains the same or worsens, consider
  - Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg (1: 1,000) 1mg/1ml: 0.3 mg IM every 3-5 minutes to a max of 0.6mg.

### Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis
- See Policy M2 - Allergic Reaction

### Smoke Inhalation
- See Policy R2 – Smoke Inhalation
