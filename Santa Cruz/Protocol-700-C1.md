# Protocol 700-C1: Cardiac Arrest

**Revision 1/19/20 Effective 8/1/18**

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Confirm DNR Status
- ✓ PIT Crew CPR. (See Reference 806 Core Principles: Managing Cardiac Arrest.)
- ✓ CPR per current County guidelines. Minimize delays and interruptions
- ✓ Apply AED and use as indicated
- ✓ **Mechanical CPR Device**
  - ⊘ After at least 2 rounds of manual CPR and defibrillation (if indicated), use a mechanical compression device wherever manual CPR is indicated and if device is available
  - ⊘ Refer to specific manufacturer's instructions for specific information
  - ⊘ Minimize interruptions when performing manual or mechanical chest compressions
  - ⊘ Upon ROSC, discontinue mechanical CPR device but leave in place should it be needed again
  - ⊘ If the patient is transported with a mechanical compression device, a rescuer from the agency that applied the device should accompany the patient to the hospital
  - ⊘ **Contraindications for mechanical CPR**
    - **Autopulse**
      - ≤17 years of age
      - Traumatic injury
    - **LUCAS**
      - Too small patient: device alerts w 3 fast signals, cannot enter PAUSE or ACTIVE mode
      - Too large patient: cannot lock the upper part of LUCAS to the backplate without compressing the patient's chest
      - Traumatic injury
- ✓ Prepare for transport/transfer of care.

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Cardiac Monitor and determine rhythm
- ✓ **Identify possible causes***
  - ⊘ Treat according to Table 1
    - **Known dialysis patients with possible hyperkalemia**
      - Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV/IO
      - Calcium Chloride 1 gram IV/IO
    - **Penetrating Chest Trauma**
      - Consider Tension Pneumothorax (see Procedure 702 Pleural Decompression)

### *Causes of Cardiac Arrest
- Hypovolemia
- Hypoxemia
- Hydrogen Ion (Acidosis)
- Hyper/Hypokalemia
- Hypothermia (E2)
- Tox (OD/Drugs) (M1)
- Tamponade (Cardiac)
- Tension Pneumothorax (702)
- Thrombosis (MI, PE)

- ✓ **If ROSC achieved:**
  - ⊘ Maintain SpO₂ ≥ 95% using lowest concentration of O₂ possible
  - ⊘ Ventilate the patient 10-12 breaths per minute to achieve an end tidal CO₂ of 35 – 45 mmHg
    - **Warning: Avoid hyperventilation**
  - ⊘ Maintain SBP ≥ 90 mmHg.
    - IV fluids, Normal saline 1 liter bolus
    - Push-dose Epinephrine 0.5 ml (5 mcg) very slow IV/IO every 3-5 minutes prn SBP < 90. See Procedure 708 Push-dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions
    - If the patient's BP is 90 systolic or higher, there is no need for any further circulatory support.
  - ⊘ Manage post-arrest arrhythmias as needed.
  - ⊘ Obtain a 12 lead ECG and transmit as indicated. Crews in South County should contact Dominican Hospital before transporting a post-arrest STEMI patient north as transport to Watsonville Community Hospital may be more appropriate.

- ✓ Consider transporting hypothermic, drug-overdosed, or electrocuted patients.

- ✓ **Consider termination of resuscitative efforts** after at least 20 contiguous minutes if: (See Policy 613 Determination of Death in the Field)
  - Unwitnessed arrest with no bystander CPR
  - No shock delivered (AED or manual defibrillator)
  - No ROSC
  - ETCO₂ waveform or readings less than 10

## Table 1: Treatment by Rhythm

### Asystole

- ✓ **Epinephrine**
  - ⊘ (1:10,000) 1mg IVP/IO
  - ⊘ Repeat q3-5 minutes for duration of arrest.
- ✓ **Consider Normal saline**
  - ⊘ 250 ml fluid challenge.
  - ⊘ May repeat as indicated.
- ✓ **If no response** consider termination of resuscitative efforts (see Policy 613, Determination of Death in the Field)

### Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA)

- ✓ **Epinephrine**
  - ⊘ (1:10,000) 1mg IV/IO
  - ⊘ Repeat q3-5 minutes for duration of arrest.
- ✓ **Consider Normal saline**
  - ⊘ 250 ml fluid challenge.
  - ⊘ May repeat as indicated.
- ✓ **If electrical HR <40 BPM** due to blunt trauma, consider determination of death prior to initiating resuscitation (see Policy 613, Determination of Death in the Field)

### Ventricular Fibrillation or Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia

- ✓ **Defibrillate ASAP**
- ✓ **Epinephrine**
  - ⊘ (1:10,000) 1mg IV/IO
  - ⊘ Repeat q3-5 min
- ✓ **Defibrillate at max. joules** as above after 5 cycles of CPR
- ✓ **Defibrillate after each medication** throughout the arrest
- ✓ **Amiodarone**
  - ⊘ 300 mg IVP/IO
  - ⊘ Repeat with 150 mg IV/IO if no response
- ✓ **If return to supraventricular rhythm,** consider:
  - ✓ Normal saline 250ml bolus

## Documentation

- ✓ Cardiac Arrest is a System Quality Indicator (See Policy 101 Quality Improvement Program and System Evaluation and Policy 502 Santa Cruz County Patient Care Record (PCR) and Transfer of Care Document)

- ✓ **Minimum documentation elements include:**
  - ⊘ Primary or Secondary Impression (esituation.11 or esituation.12) = "Cardiac Arrest - Non-traumatic"
    - Bystander CPR (PUB-1)
    - AED prior to arrival (CAR-1)
    - First Arrival time to rescuer CPR
    - Initial rhythm recorded
    - EtCO₂ readings (initial and continuous)
    - Defibrillation (number and dose)
    - Intubation (see #6)
    - ROSC (y/n) (CAR-2)
    - Survival to ED discharge (CAR-3)
    - Survival to hospital discharge (CAR-4)
