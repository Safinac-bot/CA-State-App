---

### B. Purpose and Activation

#### 2. ALS Intervention Required

#### 3. Geographic Boundary Exceeded
The responding ALS ambulance is outside of a pre-designated, County approved geographic boundary, as shown on provider specific maps, indicating that the ambulance response time will be delayed

1. **Immediately inform the dispatch center** that transportation has commenced

2. **Contact the responding ALS ambulance by radio** to coordinate the rendezvous location to be used
