# Protocol 700-M6-P: Sepsis (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Prepare for transport/transfer of care. Be sure to notify ALS responders of your suspicion for sepsis

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)

- ✓ Check blood sugar. BG >140 mg/dl in a non-diabetic patient may be a sign of sepsis. Less commonly, hypoglycemia can occur with overwhelming sepsis. Treat per Protocol 700-M7 Diabetic Emergencies.

- ✓ Check ETCO₂. ETCO₂ <25mmHg is associated with sepsis.

- ✓ Transport

- ✓ Maintain SAO₂ at 95% or greater

- ✓ **Initiate fluid resuscitation** in patients who present with signs and symptoms of severe sepsis or septic shock. Administer up to 40 ml/kg NS bolus.
  - ⊘ Administer fluid cautiously in patients with congenital heart disease. Administer in 10ml/kg boluses, repeating as indicated if the patient shows no signs of fluid overload (bulging fontanel, pulmonary edema, hypertension).

- ✓ **If inadequate improvement after 40 ml/kg Normal saline**
  - ⊘ Profound shock:
    - Push-dose Epinephrine 0.1 ml/kg (1 mcg/kg) very slow IV/IO every 3-5 minutes prn SBP < 90. See Procedure 708 Push-dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions
    - Titrate to maintain SBP > 90mmHg
    - For patients ≥ 5 kg, standard adult doses of 0.5 ml (5 mcg) will apply

- ✓ Obtain Base Station order whenever possible but do not delay care if any unusual delay.

- ✓ Contact hospital as soon as possible to report that you are transporting a patient with "suspected sepsis."

- ✓ Report and handoff at the receiving hospital should include all history and physical exam information, including that the patient has "suspected sepsis".

## Sepsis Risk Factors

- Less than 10 years.
- ***< 3 months of age very high risk**
- Hx of diabetes
- Recent hospitalization
- Recent surgery or invasive procedure
- Hx of cancer, kidney disease, malnutrition, other immune compromising diseases

---

## Special Considerations

### Sepsis Evaluation

- ⊘ Gather accurate patient information including risk factors for sepsis:

- ⊘ **Note:** The single most important element of the prehospital management of sepsis is recognizing that a patient might be septic and communicating this information to other responders and the receiving hospital as soon as possible.
