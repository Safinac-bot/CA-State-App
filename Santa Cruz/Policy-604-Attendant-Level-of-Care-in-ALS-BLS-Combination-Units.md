**Revision Date:** 5/22/18  
**Effective Date:** 8/1/18  
**EMS Medical Director:** David Ghilarducci, MD

---

## I. Purpose

To clarify when an EMT vs. a paramedic can provide direct patient care during EMS calls when responding in paramedic/EMT configured units.

---

## II. Background

### A. Range of Patient Acuity
EMS responses encompass a wide range of patient acuity (see Policy 621 Patient Acuity Guidelines).

### B. EMT Patient Care with Paramedic Availability
Many patients can be safely cared for by an EMT with a paramedic who is immediately available in the same vehicle.

### C. Operational Flexibility
Fire and ambulance crews need the flexibility to manage workload by appropriately sharing the duties of all phases of patient care, including:
- Hospital handoff
- Documentation

---

## III. General Criteria for Determining Appropriate Level of Care

### A. Assessment Authorization

Fire and ambulance paramedics and EMTs are authorized to use **any combination** of the following to determine a patient's acuity level:
- History
- Primary and secondary surveys
- First responder activity
- Vital signs
- Experience
- Judgement

---

### B. Acuity Levels 1, 2, or 3 (Paramedic Required)

Patients with **acuity levels of 1, 2 or 3** require **paramedic level management** throughout all phases of prehospital care, including during transport to the appropriate destination.

**Exception:** This rule may be waived in the event of an MCI.

---

### C. Acuity Levels 4 or 5 (EMT May Manage)

Patients with **acuity levels of 4 or 5** may be managed by EMTs on scene and during transport **provided the following conditions have been met:**

#### 1. Paramedic Assessment Required
Each level 4 or 5 patient has been assessed by a paramedic and:
- Does not require, **OR**
- Will likely not require

ALS care at any point during the prehospital phase.

**Exception:** A saline locked IV placed by the paramedic is **NOT** considered an "ALS" patient.

#### 2. Crew Agreement
Each fire or ambulance crewmember agrees that a Level 4 or 5 designation is appropriate.

---

## IV. Changes in Patient Acuity

### A. Worsening Patient Status

In instances where patients experience a worsening in their status, direct care will revert to either:
- The first response paramedic, **OR**
- Transport paramedic

---

## V. Overall Patient Care Responsibility

### A. Paramedic Oversight

While it is appropriate for EMTs to directly manage acuity level 4 and 5 patients, **paramedics on scene and during transport will still maintain overall patient care responsibility and oversight**.
