## Special Considerations

- ✓ If a trauma patient is being transported to a local hospital, make early notification.

- ✓ Most fractures on multi-systems trauma patients should be splinted to the backboard.

- ✓ Remember that the top causes of preventable trauma fatality include hypoxia, open chest wounds, and uncontrolled external hemorrhage.

- ✓ Try to adhere to the "time rule" when managing critical trauma:

- ✓ If the intervention is not critical for managing an immediate life threat, then it should not be done on scene as time is always more important.

## Documentation

- ✓ Trauma is a System Quality Indicator (See Policy 101 Quality Improvement Program and System Evaluation and Policy 502 Santa Cruz County Patient Care Record (PCR) and Transfer of Care Document)

- ✓ **Minimum documentation elements include:**
  - Scene times (TRA-1)
