# Protocol 700-M9: Non-Traumatic Hypotension (Shock)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ High-flow oxygen 15L/min
- ✓ Place patient in recovery position
- ✓ Treat associated signs and symptoms as appropriate

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)

- ✓ Assess perfusion status and if SBP <90 consider cause of hypotension (sepsis, cardiogenic, dehydration, non-traumatic bleeding, neurogenic, anaphylaxis)

- ✓ Cardiac monitor, document rhythm and attach ECG strip if dysrhythmia

- ✓ 12 Lead EKG. If STEMI see Protocol 700-C6 Suspected Cardiac Ischemia

- ✓ **Check Lung sounds**

  - ⊘ **Clear breath sounds**
    - Give IV fluids
      - Normal saline, 10ml/kg IV/IO
        - • Reassess after each 250ml increment for evidence of volume overload (pulmonary edema)
        - • Stop infusion if pulmonary edema develops
    
  - ⊘ **No response or pulmonary edema develops**
    - Push-dose Epinephrine 0.5 ml (5 mcg) very slow IV/IO every 3-5 minutes prn SBP < 90. See Procedure 708 Push-dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions
    - Titrate to maintain SBP > 90mmHg

  - ⊘ **Abnormal lung sounds (pulmonary edema)**
    - Hold IV fluids
    - Push-dose Epinephrine 0.5 ml (5 mcg) very slow IV/IO every 3-5 minutes prn SBP < 90. See Procedure 708 Push-dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions
    - Titrate to maintain SBP > 90mmHg

## Special Considerations

- ✓ Patient mortality with shock is 30-50%

- ✓ Treatment consists of oxygen, fluids and pressors. Pressors are only used when patient remains unresponsive to fluids or cannot tolerate additional fluids due to pulmonary edema.

- ✓ Patients in shock due to bleeding from traumatic injury are typically not treated with pressor in the field due to risk of greater blood loss.
