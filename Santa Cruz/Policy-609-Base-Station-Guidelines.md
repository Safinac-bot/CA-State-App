## IV. Radio-Call-In Format

Radio-Call-In Formats are needed so that Base Hospital staff will be assured of getting necessary information to prepare for a patient. In addition, a radio-call-in can also help determine which facility is best to receive a patient.

**When contacting the Base Hospital, the following information will be presented during the call-in, regardless of what format you are using:**

- Unit Identifier
- Med channel being used (when not using cellular or land line communication)
- Patient Status Level (see Policy 621 Patient Acuity Guidelines)
- Type of call-in (Notification, Consult, or Medical Control)
- Paramedics and EMTs attending
- Age and Gender
- ETA and code of transport
- Relevant patient information

---

## V. Types of Call-Ins

### A. Hospital Notification

#### 1. Purpose
Meant to prepare the ED staff for the patient's arrival.

#### 2. Timing
Make this call as soon as possible during transport.

#### 3. Include Relevant Patient Detail

**For example:**
- Patient on a backboard
- Family members onboard
- Patient being ventilated
- Exclude irrelevant information

---

### B. Base Station Consult

#### 1. Goal
The goal is to develop a plan in concert with the Base Hospital.

#### 2. Process

### D. PAM Triage

**(Policy 625 Trauma Patient Transport and Destination and Policy 626 Trauma Triage)**

#### 1. Purpose
PAM Trauma Triage call-ins are a specific subset of the Base Station Consult format.

PAM Trauma Triage call-ins are designed to help field personnel reach a destination decision in coordination with the Base Station on PAM Trauma patients that:
- Meet only Mechanism +/- Special criteria, **OR**
- Don't meet clear destination criteria as defined in Policy 625

#### 2. Required Information

**You should provide the Base Station with the following information:**

##### a) PAM Criteria Met

**(1) Important Note:**
In accordance with Policy 625, only Mechanism +/- Special criteria patients are eligible for local transport.

**Unless in extremis, physiologic and/or Anatomic criteria require transportation to a local trauma center either by air or by ground, whichever is most expeditious.**

**(2) Air Transport Preference:**
Air transport may be preferred over ground when CCT-RN level of care is needed on the scene.

##### b) Mechanism and Special Criteria Description
A detailed description of the mechanism and special criteria, if any.

##### c) Complete Head to Toe Exam
A complete head to toe exam including relevant findings and/or pertinent negatives for all body systems.
