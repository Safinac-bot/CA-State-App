# Policy 627: Emergency Department Trauma Re-Triage

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## I. Purpose
A. To outline the criteria and process for emergency re-triage and for transfer of patients needing trauma care from non-trauma facilities to appropriate trauma centers.

## II. Definitions
A. **Emergency Trauma Re-Triage:** The movement of patients meeting specific high-acuity criteria to a trauma center for trauma care. Timeliness of evaluation and intervention at the trauma center is critical.

B. **Trauma Transfer:** The movement of other patients with traumatic injuries to the trauma center (those not meeting Emergency Re-Triage criteria) whose needs may be addressed in a prompt fashion but are less likely to require immediate intervention.

## III. Policy
A. Under Policy 625 Trauma Patient Transport and Hospital Destination critical trauma patients are to be triaged directly to a Trauma Center from the field by EMS personnel. Trauma patients, who present at other facilities via EMS or other arrival mode, when medically appropriate, should be considered for re-triage or transfer to a trauma center for definitive care. It is well established that trauma patient mortality and morbidity is directly proportional to the time required to complete the transport to a trauma center, including time spent at a non-trauma center.

B. Transferring facilities should use the attached algorithm to assist with identification of those trauma patients who would benefit from care at a trauma center.

C. Transferring facilities should also make use of the process outlined in the attached algorithm to facilitate transfer to the trauma center.

## STEP 3: Arrange Appropriate Transportation

| Mode | Capability | Provider |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **ALS** | Standard Paramedic Scope. No paralyzing agents or blood products. Can sedate intubated patients with Midazolam. | 911 for RED BOX only if faster than AIR<br>Non-911 for BLUE BOX |
| **CCT-RN** | Mechanical ventilation, most medications including paralyzing agents, blood products | Critical Care RN & EMT<br>RN/RN<br>RN/Paramedic |
| **AIR Ambulance** | Mechanical ventilation, most medications including paralyzing agents, blood products | Direct Contact with Provider |

## STEP 4: Patient Preparation and Packaging

**Package patient for immediate transfer:**
