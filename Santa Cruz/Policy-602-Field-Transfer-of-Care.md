## A. Philosophy

This policy is intended to provide a guideline for the transfer of patient care in the field setting from a paramedic to an EMT when that EMT is not working with a paramedic on an ALS/BLS combination ambulance (see Policy 604).

### 1. Rationale for Step-Down of Care

On occasion, the stepping down of patient care from a paramedic to an EMT is necessary to maximize patient care with on-scene resource limitations and/or the need to rapidly transport more seriously ill or injured victims with unusual on-scene limitations or circumstances, i.e.:
- Long extrications
- Transport unit limitations
- Other unusual circumstances

### 2. Regulatory Authority

California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 22, Chapter 2, Article 2, Section 1000063, recognizes the potential for this problem and allows for the step down of patient care under local policy.

**This policy by local authority establishes how and when a paramedic may transfer patient care to an EMT in the pre-hospital care setting.**

## B. Procedure

### 1. Transfer Considerations

In every situation that appears to require that the paramedic transfer the patient care on-scene to an EMT, the following criteria must be considered:

#### a) Policy Limitations
All situations cannot be accounted for in this policy.

#### b) Goal and Direction
The goal and direction of this policy is to **match the need of the patient(s) with the highest level of care available** with the resources committed to the incident.

#### c) Consultation Requirement
If there is any question by the paramedic regarding:
- The patient's condition, **and/or**
- The propriety of leaving the patient to the care of an EMT

**Consult with the Base Station and do as directed.**

## II. First Responder Fire ALS Transfer of Care to Transport ALS

### A. Purpose

To accomplish good continuity of patient care and field collaboration of all responders, the following shall be observed whenever possible:

---

### 1. Fire Paramedic Accompaniment Requirements

#### a) Critical Patients
Patients identified as **Status Level I (Severe Distress)** or **Status Level II (In Extremis)** or identified as **Major Trauma Victims** (Physiologic and/or Anatomic criteria met) shall be accompanied by the First Responder Fire Paramedic during transport to:
- The hospital, **OR**
- Landing Zone

#### b) Transport Paramedic Requests
The Fire Paramedic will attempt to honor requests by the Transport Paramedic for the Fire Paramedic to accompany patient to the hospital.

---

### c) Reasonable Exceptions

Reasonable exceptions to the above criteria (a & b) may include situations where:

**Exception 1: Adequate Transport Resources**
- The transport unit has an intern and enough resources on-board

**Exception 2: Emergent Fire Call**
- The Fire Paramedic is requested by his/her Captain to respond to an emergent fire call

**Exception 3: MCI Event**
- An MCI event where the Incident Commander requests the Fire Medic to remain an on-scene resource

**Important:** These exception situations require cooperation between Fire and the transport unit.

---

### d) Status III-V Patients

Fire responder ALS personnel may turn over the care and transport of all **Status III-V patients** to transport providers on:
- Both combination EMT/paramedic units, **AND**
- Dual paramedic units
