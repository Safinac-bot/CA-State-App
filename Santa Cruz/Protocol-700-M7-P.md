# Protocol 700-M7-P: Diabetic Emergencies (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)

- ✓ Document history, medications, and any neurologic deficits

### Suspected Hypoglycemia

- ⊘ Provide 1 tube of oral Glucose Paste under the following circumstances:
  - Known diabetic
  - Intact Gag Reflex
  - Able to hold head upright
  - Can self-administer the paste

- ⊘ If patient doesn't improve in 5-15 minutes with oral glucose
  - Repeat 1 tube of oral Glucose Paste

### Suspected Hyperglycemia

- ⊘ Document
  - Progression of symptoms:
    - Several days (HHS)
    - Within a few hours (DKA)
  - Presence of:
    - Rapid, irregular respirations
    - Dehydration (dry mouth, sunken eyes)
    - Fruity breath

- ✓ Suspected Seizure (see Protocol 700-N2-P, Seizure)

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)

### Suspected Hypoglycemia

- ⊘ **Perform Blood Glucose check**
  - if less than 60 mg/dl treat as needed. If between 60-80 mg/dl, then use clinical judgement
    - **If conscious**
      - • Consider giving Glucose PO.
    - **If unconscious or unable to take oral sugar**
      - • Dextrose 10% 5ml/kg IV/IO up to 250 ml. Titrate to clinical response. Following initial infusion, check level of consciousness and BG Chem.

- ⊘ If BG < 60 and the patient still has altered mentation, consider repeating Dextrose 10% 5ml/kg 250 ml.
  - Recheck patency of IV line frequently.

- ⊘ If no IV can be established and patient presents with altered mentation, consider Glucagon
  - < 20 kg, give 0.5 units (0.5mg) IM
  - ≥ 20 kg, give 1 unit (1mg) IM

### Suspected Hyperglycemia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)

- ⊘ Check blood sugar level. Treat if BSL >400 mg/dl:
  - IV Normal Saline Bolus, 20ml/kg

- ⊘ Check ETCO₂
  - Values less than 25 may indicate DKA

- ✓ Transport/Contact Base Station.

- ✓ Repeat BG check enroute

## Special Considerations

- ✓ The beneficial effect of Glucagon on raising blood sugar levels is reliant on adequate glycogen stores in the liver. Debilitated or malnourished patients such chronic alcoholics or end stage cancer patients, for example, may not benefit from Glucagon. IV/IO access with dextrose administration will be crucial for these patients.
