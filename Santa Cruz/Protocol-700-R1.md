# Protocol 700-R1: Respiratory Distress

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Place patient in position of comfort.
- ✓ Observe for signs of severe respiratory distress (Table 1)
  - ⊘ Epinephrine Auto-injector (See Procedure 715 Epinephrine Auto-Injector)
    - **Warning:** Obtain Base contact for patients > 50 y/o
    - For draw and inject Epinephrine see Special Considerations below
- ✓ Prepare for transport/transfer of care.

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Cardiac Monitor and determine rhythm
- ✓ Obtain baseline SpO₂ on room air or baseline O₂ usage
  - ⊘ Titrate O₂ to main SpO₂ above 94%
- ✓ 12 lead EKG (See Procedure 706 12 Lead EKG)
- ✓ Treat in accordance with suspected condition (Table 2)
- ✓ Transport/Contact Base Station.

## Special Considerations

- ✓ Both severe fluid overload and severe bronchospasm may present with diminished lung sounds. Differentiating between conditions should be based on the patient's history.

- ✓ Epinephrine should be reserved for those patients who are unable to generate adequate tidal volume to deliver aerosolized drugs to their bronchial tree.

- ✓ In patients who are experiencing severe bronchospasm, breath sounds may sound clear with no audible wheezing. This is due to decreased tidal volume with little to no air movement. Do not withhold Albuterol with these patients.

- ✓ Provider should take caution to not get Nitro-Paste on skin.

- ✓ EMTs accredited for Optional Scope of Practice per Policy 208 EMS Responder Scope of Practice may draw and inject epinephrine in accordance with ALS procedures

## Table 2: Treatment Protocols for Respiratory Distress

### Suspected Acute CHF

- **Nitroglycerine (NTG)**
  - 0.4mg sublingual every 2 minutes. Hold if hypotensive (SBP < 90)
  - Apply 1 inch Nitro Paste. Hold if hypotensive.

- **Consider CPAP** (See Procedure 710 Continuous Positive Airway Pressure CPAP)

- **If symptomatic hypotension**
  - Positioning
  - 250ml Normal saline fluid bolus.

- **If persistent hypotension:**
  - Push-dose Epinephrine 0.5 ml (5 mcg) very slow IV/IO every 3-5 minutes prn SBP < 90. See Procedure 708 Push-dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions
  - Titrate to maintain SBP > 90mmHg

- **Warning:** Do NOT administer NTG if the patient has taken erectile dysfunction agent within the past 24 hours (i.e., Cialis, Levitra, Viagra, Revatio, Tadalafil, etc.).

### Bronchospasm (Diffuse Wheezing)

- **Albuterol: 5 mg via nebulizer**
  - Repeat Albuterol as needed
  - Obtain base contact if HR >160
  - Hold if chest pain or dysrhythmias

- **If the patient is in severe distress and his/her tidal volume decreased,**
  - administer Albuterol via in-line CPAP, BVM, or ET

- **If, after all other interventions, the patient's condition remains the same or worsens, consider**
  - Epinephrine (1:1,000) 1mg/1ml: 0.3mg IM every 3-5 minutes to a max of 0.6mg.
  - **Warning:** Base Contact required for Epinephrine 1:1,000 (0.3 mg) IM for patients > 50 y/o
    - Exception: Unusual communication delay
  - See Policy M2 - Allergic Reaction

### Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis
- See Policy M2 - Allergic Reaction

### Smoke Inhalation
- See Policy R2 – Smoke Inhalation

### Suspected Pulmonary Embolus (PE)
- Place the patient in a position of comfort
- Ensure high flow oxygen

### Decompression Illness
- Left lateral Trendelenburg position (patient on left side, body tilted with head lower than torso)
- Transport to ED for stabilization. Do not transport directly to hyperbaric chamber
