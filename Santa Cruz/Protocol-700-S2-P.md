# Protocol 700-S2-P: Apparent Life-Threatening Event (ALTE) (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Prepare for transport / transfer of care.

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Refer to appropriate protocol/s as needed.
- ✓ Transport/Contact Base Station

## Special Considerations

- ✓ An Apparent Life-Threatening Event (ALTE) was formally known as a "near miss-SIDS" episode.

- ✓ An ALTE is an episode that is frightening to the observer (may think infant has died) and involves some combination of:
  - ⊘ apnea
  - ⊘ color change
  - ⊘ marked change in muscle tone (limpness, loss of tone)
  - ⊘ choking or gagging.

- ✓ Usually occurs in infants <12 months old. However, any child <2 years who exhibits symptoms of apnea may be considered an ALTE.

- ✓ 50% have a possible identifiable etiology (e.g. abuse, SIDS, swallowing dysfunction, infection, bronchitis, seizures, CNS anomalies, tumors, cardiac disease, chronic respiratory disease, upper airway obstruction, metabolic abnormalities, anemia, etc.)

- ✓ Gather accurate history of the episode, including severity, duration, provocation, as well as an accurate patient history.

- ✓ If the parent or guardian refuses medical care/transport, Base Station MD contact is mandatory prior to completing a refusal of medical care.
