# Protocol 700-M8-P: Non-Traumatic Hypotension (Shock) (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Place patient in recovery position
- ✓ Treat associated signs and symptoms as appropriate

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)

- ✓ **Symptomatic hypotension/shock** with low blood pressure (≤90 SBP), poor skin signs, altered mental status, tachycardia, poorly palpable pulses.

  - ⊘ Consider cause (sepsis, hypovolemia, anaphylaxis, cardiac failure)
    - Establish a second IV/IO TKO
    - Give Normal saline 20cc/kg bolus
  
  - ⊘ **If inadequate improvement**
    - NO signs of congestive heart failure (lungs clear to auscultation)
      - Give additional Normal saline 20 cc/kg bolus
  
  - ⊘ **If inadequate improvement after 40 cc/kg Normal saline**
    - Profound shock:
      - Push-dose Epinephrine 0.1 ml/kg (1 mcg/kg) very slow IV/IO every 3-5 minutes prn SBP < 90. See Procedure 708 Push-dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions
        - • Titrate to maintain SBP > 90mmHg
        - • For patients ≥ 5 kg, standard adult doses of 0.5 ml (5 mcg) will apply
      - Obtain Base Station order whenever possible but do not delay care if any unusual delay.

## Special Considerations

- ✓ Symptomatic hypotension/shock is manifested by low blood pressure (≤90 SBP), poor skin signs, altered mental status, tachycardia, poorly palpable pulses. However, low blood pressure by itself does not merit aggressive treatment if the patient is not exhibiting any signs of shock. Remember to treat the patient, not the numbers.

- ✓ Avoid aggressive attempts to normalize hypotension in the setting of trauma. Consider permissive hypotension (max SBP = 90) to minimize exsanguination (See Protocol 700 T1-P Trauma)

- ✓ Transport of symptomatic hypotension/shock victims should be rapid with treatment enroute when possible.

- ✓ Septic shock is common and is characterized by younger or older age, debilitated and bedridden individuals, or immune system deficiency (such as cancer or HIV disease). (See Protocol 700 M6P Sepsis)
