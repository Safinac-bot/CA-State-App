# Protocol 700-T4-P: Hemorrhage Control (Pediatric)

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Section 700P: Pediatric Treatment Protocols

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)

- ✓ Apply substantial direct pressure using 4x4 gauze pads, abdominal, or trauma dressings.
  - ⊘ If bleeding saturates the dressing, leave in place the dressing material that is in contact with the wound, and replace outer layers with fresh dressing. Secure with pressure dressing.

### Hemorrhage to a limb:

- ⊘ In cases where substantial bleeding to a limb cannot be controlled with direct pressure and plain gauze, apply a tourniquet 2 – 3 inches above the wound and tighten until bleeding stops.

- ⊘ Assess distal circulation for absence of a pulse and bleeding control.

- ⊘ Apply a visible tag (using two-inch tape, a triage tag, etc.) and mark it with a large "T" and the time that the tourniquet was applied.

- ⊘ Inform all subsequent care providers of the location of the tourniquet, its effectiveness and its time of application.

- ⊘ If the initial tourniquet does not control bleeding, a second tourniquet may be applied 2 – 3 inches above the first and marked accordingly.

- ⊘ If substantial bleeding persists despite the use of direct pressure, tourniquets, and pressure dressings, consider the patient in extremis and transport to the closest, most appropriate facility.

- ⊘ Prepare for transport/transfer of care.

### Hemorrhage to the head, neck, or trunk

- ⊘ Large, gaping wounds to the patient's head, neck, or trunk should have pooled blood cleared out and then packed with gauze and secured as needed.

- ⊘ Avoid bulky dressings that do not allow isolation of the actual location of the bleeding, and merely act as a blood sponge.

- ⊘ It is possible for a patient to exsanguinate into bulky dressings applied without regard to hemostasis.

- ⊘ If substantial bleeding persists despite the use of direct pressure and gauze, consider the patient in extremis and transport to the closest, most appropriate facility.

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)

- ✓ Continue all BLS interventions listed above.

- ✓ If substantial bleeding persists despite the use of direct pressure, place hemostatic gauze directly on the source of the bleeding and apply direct pressure for at least three minutes. Secure with a pressure dressing.

- ✓ P.A.M. the patient and expedite transport to the appropriate facility.

- ✓ Treat other injuries and complaints as needed.

- ✓ Transport.

- ✓ Contact Base Station as needed

## Special Considerations

- ✓ Elevating bleeding extremities or applying pressure to arteries ("pressure points") has not been found to reduce substantial bleeding. These actions are not recommended in the treatment of significant external bleeding.

- ✓ Life threatening hemorrhage to a limb is better managed if it is splinted to reduce movement.

- ✓ Patients with major arterial bleeding can bleed to death in as little as two or three minutes. It is important to control external bleeding before the patient experiences shock.

- ✓ When a tourniquet is applied to an isolated wound on a patient that does not meet P.A.M. criteria, consult with the base station hospital for direction regarding patient destination.

- ✓ Any patient with a tourniquet applied should be considered to have a time dependent injury and should be transported C/3 to the appropriate hospital.

- ✓ Hemostatic gauze can be used prior to, or after, the use of tourniquets in managing severe limb hemorrhage.

- ✓ Tourniquets can be safely applied for at least 2 hours without causing irreversible, limb-threatening ischemia. In some cases, tourniquets have been applied for as long as four hours without causing irreversible limb ischemia.

- ✓ Most patients who require a tourniquet to manage bleeding should be transported to a trauma center.

- ✓ Tourniquets need to be accounted for on all patient hand-offs, and in all prehospital documentation. It is critical that the time of tourniquet application be accurately communicated to all care providers.

- ✓ Pressure dressings, tourniquets and hemostatic gauze should be reevaluated every time there is a change in the patient's status, or the patient is moved.
