## III. Child Abuse

### A. General Principles

#### 1. Purpose of Reporting
The purpose of reporting suspected child abuse/neglect is to:
- Protect the child
- Prevent further abuse of the child and other children in the home
- Facilitate treatment for the entire family

**The presence of abuse rather than the degree of that abuse is the determinant for intervention by DCFS and law enforcement.**

#### 2. Legal Requirements
California Penal Code, Sections 11166 and 11168, require mandated reporters to promptly report all suspected:
- Non-accidental injuries
- Sexual abuse
- Neglect of children

That they suspect, have knowledge of, or observe in their professional capacity.

**A verbal report shall be made to DCFS Child Protection Hotline immediately, or as soon as practically possible, and the Suspected Child Abuse Report shall be completed within 36 hours.**

#### 3. Suspicion Standard
It is not necessary for the mandated reporter to determine child abuse but **only to suspect** that it may have occurred.

**Law enforcement, DCFS and the courts determine whether child abuse/neglect has, in fact, occurred.**

#### 4. Mandatory Reporting Law
Current law mandates (CPC 11166) all healthcare professionals to report suspected child abuse/neglect that they know of or observe in their professional capacity.

**Mandated reporters are required to sign a statement acknowledging their understanding of the law.**

**Any person who fails to report as required may be punished by a fine or imprisonment.**

#### 5. Reporting Method
When a mandated reporter suspects or has observed child abuse/neglect, that individual is required to report by telephone to:
- Local law enforcement, **and/or**
- DCFS Child Protection Hotline

#### 6. Team Reporting
When two or more mandated reporters are present at scene and jointly know, or suspect an instance of child abuse/neglect:
- A member of the reporting team may be designated to report on behalf of the team
- Any member who knows that the designated reporter failed to uphold their agreement shall thereafter make the report
- If paramedics are not selected as the designated reporters, they shall document the name and agency of the designated reporting team member on the EMS Report Form

#### 7. Immunity
Persons legally required to report suspected child abuse are **immune from criminal or civil liability** for reporting as required.

**In all other instances, Adult Protective Services should be notified.**
