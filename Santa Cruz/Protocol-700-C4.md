# Protocol 700-C4: Tachycardia > 150 with Pulse

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## BLS Treatment

- ✓ Treat life threats. (See Procedure 701 Life Threats)
- ✓ Prepare for transport / transfer of care.

## ALS Treatment

- ✓ Cardiac Monitor: Confirm rate >150. If other rhythm or pulseless see Protocol 700-C1, Cardiac Arrest
- ✓ Consider 12-lead-ECG. Transmit as needed for treatment guidance.
- ✓ Treatment (see Table 1)

## Table 1: Tachycardia > 150

### Stable (SBP > 90)
**Adequate perfusion**

- ✓ Transport
- ✓ Contact Base Station.

### Borderline (SBP > 90)
**Severe chest pain, SOB, pallor, decreased LOC**

- ✓ Consider vagal maneuver (no carotid massage)
- ✓ **Consider Adenosine**
  - ⊘ 1st dose: Adenosine rapid 6mg IV/IO; if no change after 1-2 min.
  - ⊘ 2nd dose: Adenosine rapid 12mg IV/IO; if no change after 1-2 min.
  - ⊘ **Warning:** Do not use if rhythm is irregular, polymorphic or evidence of WPW (see fig 1)
- ✓ Transport/Contact Base Station.

### Unstable (SBP < 90)
**Severe chest pain, SOB, pallor, decreased LOC**

- ✓ Midazolam 5 mg IM/IN or 2.5 mg IV/IO
- ✓ **Synchronized cardioversion**
  - 100J; if no change
  - 200J; if no change
  - 300J; if no change
  - 360J
- ✓ **If patient is unstable but conscious with wide complex:**
  - ⊘ Consider Adenosine administration if there is the possibility that this rhythm is an aberrantly conducted SVT.
  - ⊘ **Warning:** Do not use if rhythm is irregular or polymorphic. Use Adenosine dosing as above.
  - ⊘ Midazolam 5 mg IM/IN or 2.5 mg IV/IO
  - ⊘ Synchronized cardioversion 100J » 200J » 300J » 360J prn
  - ⊘ Consider Amiodarone drip – 150 mg infused over 10 minutes.
- ✓ Transport/Contact Base Station.

## Special Considerations

- ✓ Consider common causes of tachycardia. See Table 2

- ✓ Consult the Base Station if you are unclear about the cause of the dysrhythmia, and whether you should treat it

- ✓ Whenever possible, contact Base Station prior to administering synchronized cardioversion in unstable but conscious patients. In the unstable, unconscious patient where rapid synchronized cardioversion is the highest priority, do not hesitate administering cardioversion before initiating transport and contacting the Base Station

- ✓ Unconsciousness should be attributed to a lack of perfusion caused by the tachycardia itself, not due to some other etiology unrelated to the tachycardia.

## Table 2: Possible Causes of Tachycardia

- Hypoxemia
- Hypothermia
- Hypovolemia
- Metabolic disorders
- Toxins/poisons/drugs
- Tamponade
- Tension pneumothorax
- Thrombosis
- Pain
- Sepsis
