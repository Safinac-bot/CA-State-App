# Procedure 703: Pain Management

**Revision 5/22/18 Effective 8/1/18**

## Purpose:

⊘ To provide monitored pain reduction to patients having moderate to severe pain. The purpose of this procedure is to provide pain management, not to eliminate pain altogether.

⊘ BLS measures should always be used prior to medication to reduce pain. BLS measures include, but are not limited to; cold packs, repositioning, elevation, splinting/immobilizing, psychological coaching, and bandaging.

## Guidelines:

⊘ **Gather a thorough patient description of the pain.**
- PQRST and 1-10 scale rating or other, age appropriate assessment tools.
- Gather a thorough physical assessment of the patient including vital signs, oxygen saturation, capnography, and EKG (when appropriate).

⊘ **Morphine**
- Drug of choice for suspected cardiac chest pain.

⊘ **Fentanyl**
- Preferred for adults and pediatrics: quicker onset, less nausea than Morphine
- Fentanyl is more potent than Morphine; Fentanyl 200 mcgs ≅ Morphine 10 mg.
  - Fentanyl is not indicated for cardiac chest pain
- Midazolam may cause respiratory depression and hypotension, particularly when used with Morphine and Fentanyl and shall not be administered with these medications.

⊘ When administering Fentanyl, and Morphine, monitor the patient closely. Have Narcan readily available to reverse any respiratory depression that may occur. Monitor with continuous pulse oximetry and end tidal capnography.

⊘ Document all medication responses in PCR; this should include any changes in the patient's pain status, as well as reassessments of vital signs.

⊘ The preferred route of administration is IV or IO; however, if an IV or IO cannot be established, administer the medication IM (except for cardiac chest pain patients).

⊘ Measurement of a patient's pain is largely subjective; therefore s/he is the best determinant of the presence and severity of pain. All patients expressing verbal or behavioral indicators of pain shall have an appropriate assessment and management as indicated and allowed by this policy.

⊘ This policy is specifically indicated for patients with moderate to severe pain. Make base station contact if there is any question about whether the patient meets inclusive criteria. Co-morbid factors such as extremes in age and significant medical problems can affect the patient's ability to tolerate pain medication. In these cases, dosing should be adjusted accordingly.

## Relative Contraindications:

⊘ Closed head injury

⊘ Decreased respirations

⊘ Inadequate perfusion

⊘ Evidence of hypoxia or hypercapnia

⊘ Altered mental status

⊘ Sudden onset acute headache
