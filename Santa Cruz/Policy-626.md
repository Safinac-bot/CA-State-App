## PAM Triage Criteria

### P: Vital Signs and Level of Consciousness: (P)hysiologic

- ☐ **Glasgow Coma Scale** ≤13
- ☐ **Systolic Blood Pressure** <90 mmHg
- ☐ **Respiratory Rate** <10 or >29 breaths/min or need for ventilator support (<20 in infant aged <1 year)

### A: Anatomy of Injury: (A)natomic

- ☐ All penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso, and extremities proximal to elbow or knee
- ☐ Chest wall instability or deformity (e.g. flail chest)
- ☐ Two or more proximal long-bone fractures
- ☐ Crushed, de-gloved, mangled, or pulseless extremity
- ☐ Amputation proximal to wrist or ankle
- ☐ Pelvic fractures
- ☐ Open or depressed skull fracture
- ☐ Paralysis

### M: Mechanism of Injury and Evidence of High-Energy Impact: (M)echanism

**Falls**
- ☐ Adults: >20 feet (one story is equal to 10 feet)
- ☐ Children: >10 feet or two or three times the height of the child

**High-risk auto crash**
- ☐ Intrusion, including roof: >12 inches occupant site; >18 inches any site
- ☐ Ejection (partial or complete) from automobile
- ☐ Death in same passenger compartment
- ☐ Vehicle telemetry data consistent with a high risk of injury

**Auto vs. pedestrian/bicyclist**
- ☐ Thrown, run over, or with significant (>20 mph) impact

**Motorcycle crash**
- ☐ >20 mph

### S: Special Patient or System Considerations

**Older Adults**
- ☐ Risk of injury/death increases after age 55 years
- ☐ SBP <110 may represent shock after age 65
- ☐ Low impact mechanisms (e.g., ground level falls) may result in severe injury

**Children**
- ☐ Should be triaged preferentially to pediatric capable trauma centers

**Anticoagulants and bleeding disorders**
- ☐ Patients with head injury are at high risk for rapid deterioration

**Burns**
- ☐ Without other trauma mechanism: triage to burn facility
- ☐ With trauma mechanism: triage to trauma center

**Pregnancy >20 weeks**

**EMS provider judgment**
