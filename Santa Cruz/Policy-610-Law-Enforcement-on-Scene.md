### Disagreement Resolution

If a disagreement arises with law enforcement on scene, the role of the EMS responder is to:
1. Request the minimum amount of time to perform an adequate history and physical assessment of the patient
2. Convey the findings and the possible need for further medical evaluation and treatment to the law enforcement agent

**In matters of disagreement regarding care, a joint decision between medical personnel and law enforcement is highly desirable.**
