**Effective Date:** 8/1/18

## I. Purpose

### A. Ensure Optimum Patient Care
To ensure optimum patient care and safety, this policy provides the opportunity for hospitals to briefly redirect incoming 911 ambulance traffic when they lack the capacity to care for another critically ill patient.

### B. Balance of Diversion Use
While diversion can provide the hospital a brief opportunity to prepare for the next critically ill patient, if overused, it can also have a significant negative effect on other hospital and ambulance resources in the county, thereby causing excessive risk to other patients in the EMS system.

### C. Objective Criteria
This policy provides objective criteria in which hospitals can request EMS patients to be diverted from their facility.

---

## II. ED Diversion/Trauma Bypass General Requirements

### A. Emergency Department Diversion Authorization

Emergency Departments may request 911 System ambulance diversion/bypass in accordance with the following:

#### 1. Resource Commitment Criteria
The hospital's Emergency Department resources are fully committed to critically and/or severely ill/injured patients and are temporarily not available for additional ALS patients.

##### a) Insufficient Justification
Lack of inpatient or intensive care unit (ICU) beds, or long wait times for low acuity patients, **are NOT sufficient justification** to implement ambulance diversion.

---

#### 2. EMResource Requirements

All Santa Cruz County Emergency Departments must use EMResource to maintain availability status:

##### a) Continuous Monitoring
EMResource is continuously monitored at each facility. This will generally require a dedicated monitor that displays EMSystem status.

##### b) Criteria Awareness
Facility personnel are aware of the criteria for implementing emergency department (ED) Diversion.

---

#### 3. Decision Authority

The diversion decision should be made by:
- The emergency physician in the emergency department
- In coordination with nursing and/or administrative staff
- Appropriate hospital representatives should be notified as soon as possible of the diversion status

**All personnel with diversion decision authority must be identified and titles prospectively communicated to the EMS Agency.**

---

#### 4. Diversion Mitigation Efforts

When on diversion, hospitals must make every attempt to:
- Maximize bed-space
- Screen elective admissions
- Use all available personnel and facility resources to minimize the length of time on diversion

---

#### 5. Documentation Requirements

A record of the diversion should be maintained by the hospital after each episode, which includes:
- A record of appropriate approval
- Type of diversion and reason for it
- Time of diversion initiation and completion

**All diversions must undergo physician review.**

---

### B. Patients NOT Eligible for Diversion

**(see Policy 621 Patient Acuity Guidelines)**

#### 1. Obstetric Patients
Obstetric Patients with imminent delivery

#### 2. In-Extremis Patients
In extremis patients with any uncontrollable problem such as:
- An unmanageable airway
- Uncontrolled hemorrhage
- Unstable cardiopulmonary condition
- Full arrest

---

## III. ED 911 System Ambulance Diversion Process

### A. Multiple Hospital Diversion
If more than one Santa Cruz County hospital requests 911 System ambulance diversion status while the other hospital is diverting, then **both hospitals will be considered GREEN**.

### B. Diversion Time Limits

**Two-Hour Maximum:**
- Hospitals may remain on RED ambulance diversion status for **no more than two hours (120 minutes) per occurrence**

**Two-Hour Open Requirement:**
- A hospital that has closed to ambulance diversion must remain open for **at least two hours (120 minutes)** before being able to divert again

### C. EMS Agency Override
When the EMS System is being negatively affected by ambulance availability, the EMS Agency may require all hospitals to become GREEN as necessary.

### D. Notification Process
The hospital shall immediately notify NetCom of any/all changes in facility status via EMResource.

**NetCom will not make any status changes by phone or radio unless EMResource has failed.**

---

## IV. Emergency Department Receiving Status

### A. Status Conditions

The following 4 status conditions apply to Emergency Departments that request the diversion of 911 System ambulances:

---

### 1. GREEN (Open)
Accepting all 911 System ambulance patients.

---

### 2. RED (Diverting 911 System Ambulances)

**Status Definition:**
Diverting all 911 System ambulance patients, **except**:
- Those in-extremis, **OR**
- Obstetric patients with imminent delivery

**Reason:**
The receiving hospital's Emergency Department is temporarily unable to accept additional patients due to the number and/or acuity of patients currently being treated.

#### a) In-Extremis Exception
Patients who are in-extremis shall be accepted by the hospital **regardless of the hospital's status**.

#### b) Status at Time of Transport
A hospital's status at the time the ambulance begins transport (not when the prehospital provider contacts the hospital with a ring-down) will apply to that transport regardless of any subsequent status changes.

---

### 3. YELLOW (Stroke Advisory)

**Status Definition:**
This is an advisory status for ambulances specifically intended to be used when a CT scanner is non-operational and immediate stroke evaluation cannot be accomplished.

**Scope:**
Other patients (abdominal pain, non-specific headache etc.) that potentially need a CT scan sometime during their evaluation shall **NOT** be affected by yellow status.

---

### 4. BLACK (Internal Disaster)

**Status Definition:**
A hospital may close to all patients (both walk-in and ambulance) if the facility or a portion of the facility is in a state of Internal Disaster as defined by the California Department of Health Care Services.

**Notification Process:**
- In such cases, the facility shall attempt to change to Internal Disaster (black) status via EMResource
- If it is not possible to change the status via this method, the hospital must contact NetCom immediately
- The facility shall report this status to the Department of Health Care Services in accordance with applicable requirements
