EMT CERTIFICATION (INITIAL)
I. PURPOSE
To specify the requirements and procedure for initial Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)
certification in Monterey County.
II. POLICY
A. To initially certify as an EMT, an applicant must satisfy all relevant State regulations and
Monterey County EMS requirements. If this policy should be superseded by changes in
State regulations, then the EMS Agency practice will be adjusted accordingly, until this
policy can be revised and disseminated.
B. The application for EMT certification is considered "received" by the EMS Agency once
EMS Agency staff have reviewed the application and supporting documents and
determined the application packet is complete.
C. To perform EMT procedures under the basic EMT scope of practice requires the
individual to obtain an EMT certificate from a Local EMS Agency (LEMSA) or other
approved certifying entity. Completion of the National Registry exam and receiving a
National Registry EMT card does not, by itself, provide certification to function as an
EMT.
D. EMT accreditation and affiliation with a Monterey County EMS service provider
organization is required to perform procedures authorized by the Monterey County EMT
Scope of Practice while functioning as an EMT for the Monterey County EMS service
provider organization as part of the Monterey County EMS system.
III. PROCEDURE

documents to the Monterey County EMS Agency through the method posted on the EMS
