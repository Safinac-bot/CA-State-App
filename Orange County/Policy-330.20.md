## I. AUTHORITY:

California Health and Safety Code, Sections 1797.220 and 1798.

---

## II. APPLICATION:

This policy describes the guidelines for evaluation, treatment, and/or transport of a minor (unemancipated child under the age of 18).

---

## III. GUIDELINES:

### A. General Policy

It is the policy of the EMS system that minors shall receive rapid evaluation, treatment, and/or transport under implied consent.

---

### B. Consent

#### 1. Voluntary Consent

Evaluation, treatment, and/or transport of a minor shall be with verbal or written consent of the parent or legal guardian, when available.

- **a.** If a parent or legal guardian is absent, responders should attempt to contact them and obtain consent. This process should not delay or interfere with patient management.

---

#### 2. Implied Consent

Evaluation, treatment and/or transport of a minor shall not be delayed in the absence of a parent or legal guardian's consent. These actions (evaluation/treatment/transport) are justified under the principle of implied consent. They may also be authorized by an officer of the law who has placed a minor in custody.

---

### C. Transport to an Emergency Receiving Center (ERC)

#### 1. Emergency Transport

A minor who needs emergency evaluation, possibly treatment, and transport when parents or a legal guardian cannot be contacted, shall be transported to the nearest or most appropriate ERC or appropriate specialty care hospital under base hospital direction.

---

#### 2. Release of Minor Without Transport

After a paramedic primary and secondary exam along with vital signs is performed, a minor who is determined not to have an injury or illness (no medical or psychiatric emergency exists, no EMT or paramedic treatment/intervention is indicated, transport not medically necessary), or has sustained only minor injuries requiring no intervention, may be released to:

- **a.** Self, if 16 years-old or older
- **b.** Parents or legal guardian
- **c.** A responsible adult or caretaker at the scene (see SO-REL)
- **d.** For other situations (age less than 16, no parents/guardian/caretaker on scene or able to be contacted), see SO-REL.
