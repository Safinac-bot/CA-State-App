## TRAUMA TRIAGE DECISION ALGORITHM

---

### STEP 1: ABNORMAL VITAL SIGNS

**Any one of:**

1. **Failure to follow commands** (motor GCS <6)

2. **Respiratory rate** < 10 or > 29 per min
   - Room air P.O₂ < 90%
   - Respiratory distress or need for respiratory support

3. **Systolic BP:**
   - Age 0-9: SBP < 70 mmHg + (2 X age in years)
   - Age 10-64 years: SBP < 90 mmHg
   - Age ≥ 65 years: SBP < 110 mmHg

4. **Heart rate:**
   - Age ≥ 10 years, heart rate > SBP

**→ Base Contact; Meets Trauma Triage Criteria**

### STEP 2: INJURY IS SIGNIFICANT

**Any one of:**

- Penetrating or open injury of the head / Depressed skull fracture
- Blunt or penetrating head injury with observed loss of consciousness, focal neurologic deficit, asymmetric pupils, or vomiting
- Penetrating (appears to penetrate all skin layers) injury to the neck, chest, abdomen, back, groin, extremity above elbow or knee
- Extremity injury with poor circulation or without a pulse
- Suspected spinal injury with new motor or sensory loss
- Blunt chest injury with abnormal respiration as defined above
- Seat belt bruising or abrasion of neck, chest or abdomen
- Blunt abdominal/flank injury with palpable tenderness
- Fracture of two or more long-bones (femur, humerus)
- Pelvic rim pain or deformity on palpation
- Amputation (partial or complete) above the wrist or ankle
- Crushed, degloved, or mangled extremity (excluding only fingers or toes)
- Pregnant woman with blunt or penetrating abdominal injury
- Active bleeding requiring a tourniquet or wound packing with continuous pressure
- Blunt head injury with bruising in area of injury and known to be taking anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors ("blood thinners") excluding aspirin; or known to have hemophilia or be a dialysis patient

**→ Base Contact; Meets Trauma Triage Criteria**

### STEP 3: MECHANISM OF INJURY

**Any one of:**

**Falls:**
- Adult/Adolescent: Greater than 10 feet
- Children: Greater than 10 feet or 2-3 times the height of the child

- Ejection (partial or complete) from automobile.
- Passenger requiring extrication
- Passenger age 0-9 years who is unrestrained
- Passenger in vehicle in which a trauma death has occurred.

**Other Mechanisms:**
- Diving and shore break injuries with suspected spinal cord injury
- Hanging
- Auto vs. Pedestrian / Bicyclist who is thrown any distance, run-over, or with significant (greater than 20 mph) impact
- Unenclosed motorized vehicle crash greater than 20 mph

**→ Base Contact; Meets Trauma Triage Criteria**
