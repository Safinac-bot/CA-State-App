## Body Surface Area Percentages by Age

### 1-4 Years
- Head: **19%**
- Torso (front): **32%**
- Each arm: **9%** (both arms = 18%)
- Each leg: **15%** (both legs = 30%)

### 5-9 Years
- Head: **15%**
- Torso (front): **32%**
- Each arm: **9%** (both arms = 18%)
- Each leg: **17%** (both legs = 34%)

### Adult (Rule of Nines)
- Head: **10%** (9% + 1%)
- Torso (front): **36%** (18% + 18%)
- Each arm: **9%** (both arms = 18%)
- Each leg: **18%** (both legs = 36%)

## Assessment Guidelines

The goal of this assessment is to determine if transport to a burn center is necessary. If the total body surface area (TBSA) burned is 10% or more, the patient should go to a burn center. Estimate the total body surface area burned using the chart or palm, then add percentages to get total. Do not count first degree burns.

### For Example:
- **Adult:** Burns to back of trunk and back of one leg = 36% / 2 + 18% / 2 = 18% + 9% = 27% TBSA
- **8 y.o. Child:** Burns to back of trunk and back of a leg = 32% / 2 + 17% / 2 = 16% + 8% = 24% TBSA

For combined burns, second and third degree, combine body surface area determination to arrive at total.

## In Orange County, the Following Should Also Be Triaged to a Burn Center:

- **Any third degree burn**
- **Suspected inhalation injury**
- **Chemical burns**
- **Second degree burns of face, genitalia, perineum, hand, and foot**
- **High voltage (> 500-1000 V) electrical injuries**
- **Pediatric (<10 years old or 30 kg)**

---

**Calculation for percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) burned does not need to be exact. The goal is to determine if TBSA is < or > 10%.**
