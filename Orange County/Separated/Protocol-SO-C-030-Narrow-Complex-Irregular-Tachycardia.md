## Clinical Condition Overview

**Narrow Complex, Irregular Tachycardia** typically represents:
- **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)** with rapid ventricular response - MOST COMMON
- Atrial Flutter with variable block
- Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Narrow QRS complex** (< 0.12 seconds)
- **Irregular rhythm** (irregularly irregular)
- **Tachycardia** (rate typically > 100 bpm)
- No consistent P-R interval pattern

---

## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Cardiac Monitoring

**Monitor and document cardiac rhythm with rhythm strip.**

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Obtain initial rhythm strip
- Clearly shows narrow QRS complexes
- Demonstrates irregularity
- Note ventricular rate
- Obtain additional strips if rhythm changes

---

### 2. Oxygen Therapy

**Pulse oximetry**; if room air oxygen saturation less than 95%:

**► High-flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow as tolerated.**

**Indications for Oxygen:**
- SpO₂ < 95% on room air
- Respiratory distress
- Chest discomfort
- Signs of poor perfusion

---

### 3. 12-Lead ECG Assessment

**If chest discomfort or acute shortness of breath reported**, consider 12-lead to evaluate for **acute MI**.

**When to Obtain 12-Lead:**
- Any chest pain or discomfort
- Acute shortness of breath
- New onset irregular tachycardia
- Concern for underlying ischemia
- Hemodynamically unstable

**Why Important:**
- AFib can be caused by acute MI
- Rapid rate increases myocardial oxygen demand
- May precipitate ischemia in CAD patients
- Helps determine hospital destination

---

### 4. Fluid Resuscitation (If Indicated)

**Assess for signs of hypovolemia**; if hypovolemia suspected and lungs clear on auscultation and no signs of CHF:

**Normal Saline, infuse 250 mL**; because of **high risk for developing CHF**, give only **one 250 mL bolus in the field** and during infusion, reassess for evidence of developing rales or worsened shortness of breath.

#### Criteria for Fluid Administration:
**ALL must be present:**
- ✓ Signs of hypovolemia (see below)
- ✓ Lungs clear on auscultation
- ✓ No signs of CHF

#### Signs of Hypovolemia:
- Hypotension (SBP < 90)
- Tachycardia with poor skin signs
- Dry mucous membranes
- Poor capillary refill
- History suggesting fluid loss (vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding)
- Orthostatic symptoms

#### **⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATION:**
**Maximum 250 mL in field ONLY**
- Do NOT give additional boluses
- High risk for flash pulmonary edema
- Loss of atrial kick reduces cardiac output
- Atrial fibrillation impairs ventricular filling

#### Monitoring During Fluid Administration:
- **Continuous lung auscultation** during and after infusion
- Watch for development of rales/crackles
- Monitor for worsening shortness of breath
- Assess respiratory rate and work of breathing
- **STOP immediately** if any signs of fluid overload

---

### 5. Transport

**ALS escort to nearest available ERC.**

**Transport Considerations:**
- Nearest Emergency Receiving Center (ERC)
- ALS monitoring en route
- Continuous cardiac monitoring
- Serial vital signs
- Reassess for changes in clinical status

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### Understanding the Pathophysiology

#### Why Atrial Fibrillation is Different:

**Loss of Atrial Kick:**
- Atria quiver instead of contracting effectively
- Loss of 20-30% of cardiac output
- Reduced ventricular filling
- Decreased stroke volume

**Implications for Treatment:**
- More susceptible to fluid overload
- Cannot compensate for volume as well
- Higher risk for CHF with aggressive fluids
- Why 250 mL limit is critical

**Irregular Ventricular Response:**
- R-R intervals vary
- Can range from 60 to 200+ bpm
- Reduces cardiac efficiency
- Shorter diastolic filling time at high rates

---

### Clinical Assessment

#### Hemodynamic Status

**Stable:**
- Normal blood pressure
- No chest pain
- No respiratory distress
- Good perfusion
- Alert and oriented

**Unstable (Consider electrical cardioversion - contact Base Hospital):**
- Hypotension with poor perfusion
- Altered mental status
- Severe chest pain/acute MI
- Severe respiratory distress/pulmonary edema
- Signs of shock

#### Symptom Assessment

**Common Symptoms:**
- Palpitations ("fluttering" or "racing heart")
- Shortness of breath
- Chest discomfort (not typical angina)
- Lightheadedness
- Fatigue, weakness
- Anxiety

**Concerning Symptoms (Suggest Instability):**
- Severe chest pain
- Syncope or near-syncope
- Severe dyspnea
- Signs of CHF (rales, JVD, peripheral edema)
- Altered mental status

---

### Distinguishing Narrow Complex Irregular Tachycardias

#### Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) - MOST COMMON
**Characteristics:**
- **Irregularly irregular** rhythm (no pattern)
- No discernible P waves
- Wavy baseline (fibrillatory waves)
- Narrow QRS complexes
- Variable ventricular rate

**Clinical Context:**
- Most common sustained arrhythmia
- Increases with age
- Associated with CHF, hypertension, valvular disease
- Risk for stroke (blood clots in atria)

---

#### Atrial Flutter with Variable Block
**Characteristics:**
- "Sawtooth" flutter waves
- Usually regular but can be irregular if variable block
- Flutter waves typically 250-350/min
- Ventricular rate depends on block (2:1, 3:1, variable)
- Narrow QRS

**Clinical Context:**
- Less common than AFib
- Often converts to AFib
- Similar treatment approach

---

#### Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)
**Characteristics:**
- Irregular rhythm
- **At least 3 different P wave morphologies**
- Variable P-R intervals
- Narrow QRS
- Rate > 100 bpm

**Clinical Context:**
- Often associated with COPD
- Seen in critically ill patients
- Hypoxia, acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities
- Treatment focuses on underlying cause

---

### Risk Factors for Atrial Fibrillation

**Cardiac Causes:**
- Hypertension (most common)
- Coronary artery disease
- Heart failure
- Valvular heart disease (especially mitral)
- Cardiomyopathy
- Pericarditis

**Non-Cardiac Causes:**
- Hyperthyroidism
- Electrolyte abnormalities (low K⁺, Mg²⁺)
- Alcohol use ("holiday heart syndrome")
- Pulmonary embolism
- Pneumonia
- COPD exacerbation
- Sleep apnea

**Other Risk Factors:**
- Advanced age
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Obstructive sleep apnea
- Family history

---

### Why Rate Control (NOT) in Prehospital Setting

**No Rate Control Medications in This Protocol:**
- Diltiazem, metoprolol NOT included
- Risk of hypotension
- Risk of worsening CHF
- Complex dosing considerations
- Short transport times

**Hospital Will Manage Rate Control:**
- IV diltiazem or metoprolol
- Can monitor continuously
- Can manage complications
- Can assess for cardioversion vs rate control

**Focus on Supportive Care:**
- Oxygenation
- Symptom management
- Identify underlying causes
- Safe transport
- Appropriate destination

---

### When to Consider Cardioversion (Base Hospital Contact)

**Not typically performed in field**, but cardioversion may be considered by Base Hospital if:

**Patient Unstable with AFib:**
- Hypotension with poor perfusion
- Acute pulmonary edema
- Chest pain/acute MI
- Altered mental status due to hypoperfusion

**Synchronized Cardioversion:**
- Must be synchronized (NOT defibrillation)
- Requires sedation if conscious
- Base Hospital order required
- Usually 120-200 J biphasic

**This protocol does NOT include cardioversion** - focus is on stable patients with supportive care.

---

## Special Considerations

### New Onset vs. Chronic AFib

#### New Onset (< 48 Hours):
- Higher risk for symptoms
- May be more amenable to cardioversion
- Lower risk for clot formation
- Document onset time if known

#### Chronic/Persistent AFib:
- Patient may be asymptomatic at baseline
- Often on rate control medications
- Usually on anticoagulation (warfarin, DOACs)
- Higher bleeding risk if anticoagulated

**Ask Patient:**
- Is this new for you?
- Do you have AFib normally?
- When did this start?
- What medications do you take?
- Are you on blood thinners?

---

### Anticoagulation Considerations

**Common Anticoagulants:**
- Warfarin (Coumadin)
- Apixaban (Eliquis)
- Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)
- Dabigatran (Pradaxa)
- Edoxaban (Savaysa)

**Implications:**
- **Higher bleeding risk** with trauma
- Important for hospital to know
- Document all medications
- Ask about recent bleeding
- Note any signs of bleeding

---

### Stroke Risk with Atrial Fibrillation

**Why AFib Causes Strokes:**
- Blood pools in atria (no effective contraction)
- Clots form in left atrial appendage
- Clots embolize to brain (and other organs)
- AFib increases stroke risk 5-fold

**If Patient Has Stroke Symptoms:**
- Facial drooping
- Arm weakness
- Speech difficulty
- Refer to stroke protocol
- Rapid transport
- Notify receiving facility

---

### AFib with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR)

**Definition:** AFib with rate > 100 bpm (often > 120-150)

**Clinical Significance:**
- Reduced diastolic filling time
- Decreased cardiac output
- Increased myocardial oxygen demand
- Can precipitate ischemia or CHF
- More symptomatic for patient

**Assessment:**
- Note ventricular rate
- Assess hemodynamic stability
- Look for signs of ischemia
- Check for CHF
- Consider 12-lead ECG

---

### CHF and Atrial Fibrillation

**Why They Often Coexist:**
- AFib can cause CHF (loss of atrial kick, rapid rate)
- CHF can cause AFib (atrial stretch)
- Common risk factors (HTN, CAD)

**Be Very Cautious with Fluids:**
- Even if patient appears hypovolemic
- 250 mL maximum
- Watch for rales
- Monitor closely
- Stop immediately if CHF develops

**Signs of CHF:**
- Crackles/rales on lung auscultation
- Jugular venous distension (JVD)
- Peripheral edema
- Orthopnea (can't lie flat)
- Pink, frothy sputum
- S₃ gallop (if you can hear it)

---

✓ **Supportive care** - oxygen, monitoring, 12-lead if indicated  
✓ **Fluid restriction** - maximum 250 mL if hypovolemic AND lungs clear  
✓ **High CHF risk** - loss of atrial kick reduces cardiac output  
✓ **Watch for MI** - 12-lead if chest pain or acute SOB  
✓ **No rate control meds** in prehospital setting for this protocol  
✓ **Monitor continuously** - rhythm can change  
✓ **Document anticoagulation** - important for hospital  
✓ **ALS transport** to nearest ERC  
✓ **Base contact** if unstable or concerns about cardioversion need
