## INDICATION:

Decompression of tension pneumothorax causing hemodynamic instability in a pediatric chest injury victim.

---

## SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX:

**Signs include:**

- Chest injury, either blunt or penetrating (often with flail chest, palpable subcutaneous air, or "sucking" chest wound on side of suspected pneumothorax).

- Absence of breath sounds on the side of the suspected pneumothorax (if breathing); with presence of breath sounds on side without pneumothorax.

**Symptoms include:**

- Progressive dyspnea or respiratory arrest

- Poor perfusion and altered mental status.

---

## PROCEDURE:

- Make base contact (if in setting of an MCI, remote rescue, or tactically unstable scene proceed without base contact and document).

- Explain procedure to patient if conscious and able to understand.

- Assemble equipment:
  - 1.25 inch, 16 gauge catheter over needle if estimated weight 40 Kg (90 lbs) or less, use adult decompression needle (minimum 2.5 inch length) if estimated weight greater than 40 Kg.
  - Antiseptic skin wipes
  - Sterile Vaseline gauze

- Identify second intercostal space, midclavicular line.

- Prepare site with sterile skin wipe.

- Insert needle using steady pressure and ninety-degree angle (perpendicular) to chest wall in lower aspect of the second intercostal space within the midclavicular line.

- Advance needle until one of the following are recognized:
  - A sudden rush of air is expelled through the needle
  - A "popping" or "giving way" is felt as the tip of the needle enters the chest cavity
  - Air, blood or fluid is expelled through the needle when chest cavity has been entered

- Once chest cavity is entered, advance needle and catheter ¼ inch and no further, remove needle, leaving catheter in place.

- Arrange Vaseline gauze at base of catheter to stabilize and seal area and leave in place (do not reinsert needle into catheter due to risk of shearing apart plastic catheter).
