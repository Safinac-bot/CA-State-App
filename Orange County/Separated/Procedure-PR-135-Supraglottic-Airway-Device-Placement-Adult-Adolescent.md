## INDICATIONS:

A supraglottic airway (SGA) is indicated for securing an airway during resuscitation of an unconscious patient. An SGA is an advanced airway technique to assist with oxygenation and ventilation.

An SGA may be placed by an Orange County Accredited Paramedic in the following situations:

• Primary advanced airway for an unconscious adult/adolescent patient lacking a gag reflex in need of airway protection and ventilation.

• Advanced airway if intubation is anticipated to be difficult and rapid airway control is necessary.

• Advanced airway in adult cardiac arrest when attempts at intubation are likely to interrupt continuous chest compressions.

• Advanced airway when intubation has been unsuccessful.

---

## CONTRAINDICATIONS:

• Intact gag reflex

• Known caustic substance ingestion

• Unresolved upper airway obstruction

• Trismus or limited ability to open the mouth such that the device cannot be inserted after sedation with 5 mg of midazolam IV, IO, or IM

• Oral trauma with bleeding, swelling or unstable jaw fracture

• Distorted anatomy that prohibits proper placement (such as oropharyngeal mass or abscess)

• Patients under 50 kg

• Known esophageal disease

• Laryngectomy patient with stoma (open tracheostomy site or tube)

• Ability to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation with less invasive method

---

## PROCEDURE:

### 1. Secure Required Equipment:

- Personal protective equipment (gloves need not be sterile)
- SGA (Appropriate size for patient)*
- Bag-valve-mask
- Stethoscope
- Water-based lubricant
- Means for securing SGA
- Waveform end tidal CO2 capnography
- Pulse oximetry monitoring
- Cardiac monitor
- (Optional size 12F or 14 F gastric tube)

### 2. Clear Airway with Suction; Pre-Ventilate with BVM 100% Oxygen and Select Appropriate Size SGA.*

### 3. If SGA Has Inflatable Cuff, Test Cuff for Leaks and Then Deflate Before Insertion.

### 4. Prepare SGA for Insertion and Lubricate SGA Following Manufacturer Instructions.

### 5. Position the Head into the "Sniffing Position". Neutral Position for Suspected Cervical Spine Injury.

### 6. Hold Mouth Open and Apply Chin-Lift Maneuver (Jaw-Thrust for Suspected C-Spine Injury).

### 7. Introduce the Leading SGA Soft Tip into the Mouth in a Direction Towards the Roof of the Mouth (Hard Palate).

### 8. Glide the Device Downwards and Backwards Along the Hard Palate with a Continuous But Gentle Push Until Resistance to Further Advancement is Felt.

### 9. The SGA Should Be Advanced Against the Resistance of the Upper Esophageal Opening and Positioned with the Leading Soft Tip Resting in the Esophageal Opening (Not Advanced into the Esophagus).

### 10. If Device Has an Inflatable Cuff, Inflate to Manufacturer Recommended Pressure.

### 11. Confirm Placement by Auscultating Bilateral Breath Sounds and Absence of Epigastric Sounds.

### 12. Confirm Placement with End-Tidal CO2 Monitoring.

### 13. Secure the SGA.

### 14. Document the Following in the ePCR:
a. Size of the SGA  
b. Number of attempts to place the SGA and if successful  
c. Pulse oximetry  
d. End-Tidal CO2 – as a numerical value AND as a method of airway confirmation.

## Airway Removal

Once an SGA is placed, it ideally should not be removed. Circumstances that necessitate removal of the device may include inadequate ventilation with the device, return of a gag reflex, or vomiting.

Removal of the device may cause vomiting, use the following steps:

1. Position patient on side, maintain spinal motion restrictions as needed.
2. Have suction immediately available and remove the airway.
3. Reassess airway and breathing to evaluate the need for further assisted ventilation.
