## ALS STANDING ORDERS

Allergic reactions may be mild to life threatening (termed anaphylaxis), treat based on the following assessment findings:

---

## I. Allergic Reaction:

### Allergic Reaction with Only Rash or Urticaria

**Allergic reaction with only rash or urticaria, and with stable vital signs and no history of anaphylaxis:**

**→ Pulse oximetry: if room air oxygen saturation less than 95%, manage as anaphylaxis as described below.**

**→ Transport to nearest appropriate ERC. ALS escort if history of anaphylaxis.**

---

### Allergic Reaction Limited Only to Facial/Cervical Angioedema:

**► Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg IM lateral thigh area (1 mg/1 mL concentration) – one time (limit one time dose to maximum of 0.5 mg). HOLD if Epinephrine Auto-injector administered prior to arrival.**

**► Oxygen by mask (high flow), blow by technique, or nasal cannula (for blow by or nasal cannula provide 6 l/min flow rate) as tolerated.**

**► Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) 1mg/kg IM/IV/IO once (limit one time dose to maximum of 50 mg or 1 mL of 50 mg/mL solution). Do not administer if diphenhydramine taken prior to arrival.**

**→ ALS escort to nearest appropriate ERC.**

---

## II. Anaphylaxis:

**Anaphylactic reaction includes hypotension, wheezing, hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 95% saturation), stridor, intra-oral swelling, gastrointestinal symptoms, and/or impending airway obstruction:**

**► Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg IM lateral thigh area (1 mg/1mL concentration). Maximum dose 0.5 mg. If Epinephrine Auto-injector administered prior to arrival, consider one dose of epinephrine has been provided.**

**► Oxygen by mask (high flow), blow by technique, or nasal cannula (for blow by or nasal cannula provide 6 l/min flow rate) as tolerated.**

**→ Establish IV/IO access. If hypotensive,**

**► Infuse normal saline 20 mL/kg IV/IO bolus (maximum 250 mL) and make BH contact. May repeat twice for total of three boluses as a standing order.**

**→ If wheezing or hypoxic (initial room air pulse oximetry less than 95% saturation):**

**► Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated.**

**→ After initial IM epinephrine given as above, if after approximately 5 minutes there is continued hypotension, respiratory distress, or impending airway obstruction, consider administration of second dose of epinephrine by one of the following routes:**

**► Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg IM lateral thigh (1 mg/1 mL concentration), maximum single dose 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) OR**

**Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO (1 mg/10 ml concentration), maximum single dose 0.3 mg (3 mL)**

**► Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) 1mg/kg IM/IV/IO once (limit one time dose to maximum of 50 mg or 1 mL of 50 mg/mL solution). Do not administer if diphenhydramine taken prior to arrival.**

**→ Contact Base Hospital (CCERC base preferred) and ALS escort as directed to CCERC or ERC.**

---

## Patients Self-Treated with Epi-Pen (Epinephrine Auto-Injector) Prior to EMS Arrival:

**Consider patient having received first epinephrine IM dose and follow above steps.**

**ALS escort to ERC or if appropriate, contact Base Hospital (CCERC base preferred) for further evaluation even when symptoms resolving.**
