## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Cardiac Monitoring

**Cardiac monitor, document rhythm.**

---

### 2. Oxygen Therapy

**Pulse oximetry, if room air oxygen saturation less than 95%, provide:**

**► High flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow rate as tolerated.**

---

### 3. Vascular Access

**Establish venous access:**

**► IV access (if unresponsive to regular stimuli consider IO if peripheral IV cannot be established).**

---

### 4. Fluid Resuscitation

**For signs of poor perfusion (poor skin signs, altered mental status, weak pulses) and if lungs clear to auscultation (no evidence CHF):**

**► Infuse 250 mL Normal Saline bolus, may repeat up to maximum 1 liter to maintain adequate perfusion.**

---

### 5. Base Hospital Contact

**Contact Base Hospital if hypotension does not response to Normal Saline hydration.**

**If rales noted on lung auscultation, suspect cardiogenic shock, contact Base Hospital for further orders.**

---

### 6. Acute MI Assessment

**Assess for "Acute MI"**

**► 12-lead ECG if MI suspected, if "Acute MI" indicated or a STEMI is suspected based on paramedic interpretation of 12-lead ECG, contact Base Hospital for CVRC destination.**

---

### 7. Transport

**ALS escort to nearest ERC or contact Base Hospital as needed.**

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### Definition of Symptomatic Hypotension/Shock:

**Symptomatic hypotension/shock is manifested by low blood pressure (<90 systolic), poor skin signs, altered mental status, tachycardia, poorly palpable pulses.**

---

### Transport Priority:

**Transport of symptomatic hypotension/shock victims should be rapid with treatment enroute when possible.**

---

### Septic Shock Recognition:

**Septic shock is often encountered in the field and is characterized by younger or older age, debilitated and bedridden individuals, or immune system deficiency (such as cancer or HIV disease).**

**Septic shock patients often have fever and altered mental status that commonly presents as a slow response to the environment.**

**Septic shock patients are often hypoxic (O₂ saturation <95%) with rapid respiratory rates.**

**In early septic shock, vital signs are often within "normal" parameters (refer to SO-M-55, Suspected Sepsis).**
