## Types of Bradycardia

### Sinus Bradycardia
**Characteristics:**
- Regular rhythm
- P wave before each QRS
- Normal QRS width
- Rate < 60 bpm

**Clinical Significance:**
- May be normal (athletes, sleep)
- Symptomatic if rate too slow or underlying disease
- Responds well to atropine

---

### First-Degree AV Block
**Characteristics:**
- PR interval > 0.20 seconds
- All P waves conducted
- Regular rhythm
- Every P has a QRS

**Clinical Significance:**
- Usually benign
- May progress to higher degrees
- Monitor closely
- Atropine may shorten PR interval

---

### Second-Degree AV Block Type I (Wenckebach/Mobitz I)
**Characteristics:**
- Progressive PR interval prolongation
- Eventually one QRS dropped
- Cycle repeats
- Usually narrow QRS

**Clinical Significance:**
- Usually benign
- Block at AV node level
- Rarely progresses to complete block
- May respond to atropine
- Often transient

---

### Second-Degree AV Block Type II (Mobitz II)
**Characteristics:**
- Fixed PR interval
- Intermittent dropped QRS complexes
- No warning before drop
- Usually wide QRS

**Clinical Significance:**
- **HIGH RISK** for progression to complete block
- Block below AV node (His-Purkinje)
- Poor response to atropine
- May need pacing urgently
- Consider prophylactic pacing

---

### Third-Degree (Complete) AV Block
**Characteristics:**
- P waves and QRS complexes completely independent
- No relationship between atrial and ventricular activity
- Escape rhythm maintains heart rate
- Wide QRS if ventricular escape
- Narrow QRS if junctional escape

**Clinical Significance:**
- **CRITICAL** - often symptomatic
- High mortality if untreated
- May need immediate pacing
- Atropine often ineffective
- Unstable rhythm - can deteriorate suddenly

**Escape Rhythm Location:**
- Junctional (narrow QRS): Rate 40-60, more reliable
- Ventricular (wide QRS): Rate 20-40, less reliable, unstable

---

### Junctional Bradycardia
**Characteristics:**
- No P waves OR inverted P waves
- P waves may be before, during, or after QRS
- Usually narrow QRS
- Rate 40-60 bpm
- Regular rhythm

**Clinical Significance:**
- AV node is pacemaker
- May be normal backup when SA node fails
- Usually well-tolerated
- Treat only if symptomatic

---

## Special Populations

### Athletes

**Normal Physiologic Bradycardia:**
- Resting HR commonly 40-50 bpm
- Result of increased vagal tone
- Higher stroke volume compensates
- Usually asymptomatic at rest

**Assessment:**
- Ask about athletic activity level
- Check if baseline for patient
- Assess for symptoms
- No treatment if asymptomatic
- Should increase HR with activity

**When to Treat:**
- If symptomatic (rare)
- If associated with syncope
- If different from patient's baseline
- If doesn't increase appropriately with activity

---

### Elderly Patients

**Considerations:**
- More prone to symptomatic bradycardia
- May have sick sinus syndrome
- Often on multiple cardiac medications (polypharmacy)
- Higher risk for adverse medication effects
- May have underlying conduction disease

**Common Causes:**
- Degenerative conduction system disease
- Multiple medications (beta-blockers, CCBs, digoxin)
- Acute illness/infection
- Hypothyroidism
- Prior cardiac surgery

**Treatment Considerations:**
- Lower threshold for intervention
- More likely to need pacing
- Base Hospital consultation important
- Medication reconciliation critical

---

### Inferior MI Patients

**Why Bradycardia Occurs:**
- Right coronary artery occlusion common
- RCA supplies SA node (60% of people)
- RCA supplies AV node
- Vagal stimulation from inferior wall ischemia
- Bezold-Jarisch reflex

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Bradycardia with chest pain
- Often with hypotension
- May have nausea/vomiting (vagal)
- May have right ventricular involvement

**Treatment Considerations:**
- Atropine often effective
- May need multiple doses
- Usually temporary - resolves with reperfusion
- Watch for right ventricular infarction
- Cautious with fluids if RV involvement suspected
- Early 12-lead ECG critical
- CVRC destination for STEMI

**12-Lead Findings:**
- ST elevation in II, III, aVF (inferior)
- May see reciprocal depression in I, aVL
- Consider right-sided leads (V4R)
- Bradycardia suggests RCA occlusion

---

### Heart Transplant Patients

**Denervated Heart:**
- No vagal or sympathetic innervation
- Cannot respond to autonomic stimuli
- Fixed intrinsic rate (usually 90-110)

**Treatment Implications:**
- **Atropine is INEFFECTIVE** (no vagal tone to block)
- May need pacing sooner
- Consider chronotropic agents (epinephrine, dopamine)
- Push-dose epinephrine may be ordered by Base
- Early Base Hospital contact critical

**If Bradycardic:**
- Unusual for transplant patient
- Suggests serious problem
- May indicate rejection
- May indicate medication effect
- Treat aggressively

---

### Hypothermic Patients

**Bradycardia with Hypothermia:**
- Progressive bradycardia as temperature drops
- < 32°C (90°F): significant bradycardia
- < 28°C (82°F): high risk for V-fib

**Treatment Considerations:**
- Do NOT give atropine (ineffective, may harm)
- Do NOT pace unless severe (can induce V-fib)
- Focus on rewarming
- Gentle handling (avoid triggering dysrhythmias)
- Base Hospital contact essential
- May see Osborn (J) waves on ECG

---

## Contraindications and Precautions

### Atropine

**Use with Caution:**
- Acute myocardial ischemia (increases O₂ demand)
- Heart transplant (ineffective)
- High-degree AV blocks (may worsen)
- Hypothermia (ineffective, may cause dysrhythmias)

**Potential Adverse Effects:**
- Tachycardia (excessive)
- Increased myocardial oxygen consumption
- Paradoxical bradycardia with doses < 0.5 mg
- Urinary retention (anticholinergic)
- Pupil dilation (may complicate neuro exam)
- Confusion/agitation (especially elderly)

**When Atropine Unlikely to Work:**
- Type II second-degree AV block
- Third-degree AV block
- Heart transplant
- Hypothermia
- Drug overdose (beta-blocker, CCB)

---

### Transcutaneous Pacing

**Contraindications:**
- None absolute in life-threatening bradycardia
- Avoid if unnecessary (discomfort)

**Precautions:**
- **PAINFUL** - requires sedation if conscious
- May not achieve mechanical capture
- Can cause skin burns with prolonged use
- Interferes with chest compressions if arrest occurs
- Do not delay for hypothermia (may trigger V-fib)

**Common Problems:**
- Failure to capture (increase output)
- Electrical but not mechanical capture
- Patient intolerance
- Skin irritation/burns
- Muscle twitching

**Tips for Success:**
- Clean and dry skin
- Anterior-posterior pad placement preferred
- Confirm mechanical AND electrical capture
- Start output low and increase
- Set rate 60-80 bpm
- 2 mA above capture threshold
- Sedate if BP allows

---

### Midazolam (Versed®)

**Contraindications:**

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall #1: Treating Asymptomatic Bradycardia
**Problem:** Giving atropine to stable patient with HR 50
**Solution:** 
- Always assess for SYMPTOMS first
- HR < 60 alone is NOT an indication for treatment
- Athletes may have HR 40-50 normally
- Treat symptoms, not numbers

### Pitfall #2: Inadequate Atropine Dosing
**Problem:** Giving 0.5 mg doses or stopping after 1 dose
**Solution:**
- Always give 1 mg doses (never less)
- Can repeat every 3-5 minutes
- Max total dose is 3 mg
- Don't stop after one dose if still symptomatic

### Pitfall #3: Delaying Pacing
**Problem:** Giving multiple atropine doses in deteriorating patient
**Solution:**
- If first atropine dose ineffective, prepare for pacing
- Don't wait until patient codes
- Pace early in high-degree blocks
- Can pace while continuing atropine

### Pitfall #4: Assuming Electrical Capture = Success
**Problem:** Seeing wide QRS after pacer spike, assuming patient stable
**Solution:**
- ALWAYS check for mechanical capture (pulse)
- Electrical capture without mechanical is FAILURE
- Must palpate pulse with each paced beat
- Check BP to confirm perfusion

### Pitfall #5: Sedating Hypotensive Patient
**Problem:** Giving midazolam with SBP 85
**Solution:**
- NEVER sedate if BP < 90
- Will worsen hypotension
- May cause arrest
- Treat BP first, then consider sedation

### Pitfall #6: Fluids in CHF
**Problem:** Giving fluid boluses without checking lung sounds
**Solution:**
- ALWAYS auscultate lungs before fluids
- Clear lungs = OK to give fluids
- Rales/crackles = NO fluids
- Recheck after each bolus

### Pitfall #7: Missing Inferior STEMI
**Problem:** Not obtaining 12-lead in bradycardic patient
**Solution:**
- Bradycardia + chest pain = get 12-lead ASAP
- Inferior STEMI commonly causes bradycardia
- RCA supplies AV node
- Needs CVRC destination

### Pitfall #8: No Base Contact When Required
**Problem:** Successfully pacing patient, going to closest ER
**Solution:**
- Successful capture = Base contact REQUIRED
- May need CVRC destination
- Get orders for push-dose epi if needed
- Document Base contact
