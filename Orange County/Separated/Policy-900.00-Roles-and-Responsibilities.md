## IV. MULTI-CASUALTY INCIDENT

### A. ACTIVATION OF THE MULTI-CASUALTY INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN

Activation of the MCI response plan occurs when fire service responders announce that the Orange County Fire Services Operational Area Plan Annex Mass Casualty Incident Plan is implemented for a specific incident.

---

### B. ROLE OF FIRE DISPATCH CENTERS DURING AN MCI

Upon notification of multiple victims and the establishment of Command, the fire dispatcher will contact Orange County Communications (OCC) and provide the location and type of incident, and the estimated number of victims.

---

### C. ROLE OF MEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS COORDINATOR (Med Com)

1. The Medical Communications Coordinator (Med Com) maintains communications between the field and the assigned Base Hospital to coordinate information and receiving center assignments between the Base Hospital and field Command and transport units.

---

### D. ROLE OF ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNICATIONS (OCC) DURING AN MCI

1. When notified of an MCI, OCC will assign a coordination talk group (6-Bravo through 6-Kilo) for use by Med Com and assign a base hospital.

2. Notify the Base Hospital normally assigned to the area of the MCI and provide the type of incident, location, and estimated number of casualties. An alternate base will be utilized in the event the preferred base is already handling another call(s).

3. When notified by a transporting field ALS Unit participating in the MCI of the need for a base assignment for radio contact, assign to the Base managing the MCI. If the base is unable to handle the call, OCC will assign an alternate Base.

4. Notify the EMS Duty Officer on-call for incidents involving 20 or more victims.

5. Separate from this plan, the Orange County Fire Services Operational Area Plan Annex Mass-Casualty Incident Plan provides for expansion of an MCI to a level that Orange County Communications (OCC) rather than an Orange County Base Hospital can be contacted for receiving center destination determinations.

---

### E. ROLE OF BASE HOSPITALS (BH) DURING AN MCI

1. The base hospital will receive notification of an MCI from OCC. Information will include the location, a general incident description, and estimated number of casualties.

2. The MICN will initiate an MCI by activating the ReddiNet MCI Module and select hospitals to poll as potential receiving facilities. At a minimum, the MICN must poll all BHs so they are aware of the incident. The predetermined PCCI of trauma centers and emergency receiving centers (ERCs) will be available on ReddiNet and is used for initiating immediate MCI victim destination assignments.
   - a. In the event that the ReddiNet System fails, the MICN will use telephone (or other available communication systems) contact to alert receiving centers of victims being transported.
   - b. The PCCI attached to this policy is used for initial destination determinations for MCI victims if the ReddiNet System fails.

3. Med Com will contact the BH to provide ongoing incident information and coordinate transport of MCI victims from the scene.

4. The MICN will receive the MCI PATIENT REPORT from Med Com to include (when available): Tag #, Triage Category, Age, Gender, Major Injuries, Vital Signs, Destination or Specialty Request, and Ambulance Identifier; assign a hospital destination; and relay that destination to Med Com. Patient report information (vital signs, injuries) should be entered into the ReddiNet Chief Complaint section so that receiving facilities can anticipate the incoming patient's needs.

5. The Base Hospital MCI Worksheet is used to collect data with this information transferred to an electronic Base Hospital Report at the conclusion of the MCI. Documentation for minor (BLS) level patients may be minimal, but at minimum, must include age, gender, and last three digits of Triage Tag number.

6. Victims identified as meeting specialty criteria are preferentially assigned to specialty centers based upon field triage, Med Com/BH communications, and specialty bed availability. In the event of a large-scale MCI, the BH will need to prioritize which specialty center criteria patients would benefit most from available specialty center beds. For specialty designated patients, the MICN will relay an abbreviated report to the receiving hospital when possible.

7. If a paramedic requires on-line medical direction while transporting to a receiving hospital, OCC will assign the same BH managing the MCI for further orders.

### F. ROLE OF FIELD PROVIDERS DURING AN MCI

#### ALS Providers:

1. ALS MCI procedures are described in the Orange County Fire Annex MCI Plan.

2. ALS providers should relay the following information, when available, to Med Com to facilitate BH entry of patient information into ReddiNet (which serves as ERC notification): Tag #, Triage Category, Age, Gender, Major Injuries, Vital Signs, Destination or Specialty Request, and Ambulance Identifier.

3. Med Com will receive ERC destinations from the BH and communicate with transporting providers. Communication of scene details and the scope of the incident from Med Com to the BH will aid in BH destination decision making.

4. If the escorting paramedic needs to contact the assigned receiving center to provide a patient status update, the paramedic must clarify that the MCI patient is already assigned to the receiving hospital, and should reference the patient's age, sex, and Tag# to avoid confusion.

5. If a paramedic requires on-line medical direction while transporting to a receiving hospital, they should request OCC assign them to the same BH managing the MCI.

#### BLS Providers:

1. BLS providers should relay the following information, when available, to Med Com to facilitate BH entry of patient information into ReddiNet (which serves as ERC notification): Tag #, Triage Category, Age, Gender, Major Injuries, Vital Signs, Destination Request, and Ambulance Identifier.

2. Med Com will receive ERC destinations from the BH and communicate with transporting providers. Communication of scene details and the scope of the incident from Med Com to the BH will aid in BH destination decision making.

3. If the escorting EMT needs to contact the assigned receiving center to provide a patient status update, the EMT must clarify that the MCI patient is already assigned to the receiving hospital, and should reference the patient's age, sex, and Tag# to avoid confusion.

---

### G. ROLE OF REDDINET/H.E.A.R. ACTIVATED HOSPITALS DURING AN MCI

1. Acknowledge the MCI ACTIVATION ALERT via the ReddiNet.

2. Review ReddiNet report from the BH managing the MCI. May only include number of patients and acuity.

3. Immediately update the ReddiNet PCCI when the ReddiNet MCI Screen is activated.

4. Victims of a declared MCI that have been assigned to a receiving facility by the BH may not be diverted by that receiving facility unless that facility is closed due to internal disruption as defined in OCEMS Policy 310.96.

5. Monitor, revise, and update the facility's PCCI as casualties are received.

6. Identification data for MCI victims received will immediately be entered into ReddiNet. Victims will be tracked using the last 3 digits of the Triage Tag number.

7. MCI victims will arrive with a Triage Tag. Hospitals shall retain the Triage Tag as part of the patient hospital medical record.

8. Continue to update the casualties received data screens on the ReddiNet system until all available information is entered.

---

### H. ROLE OF ORANGE COUNTY EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (OCEMS)

1. Receive MCI information when provided by OCC and monitor the ReddiNet.

2. Advise appropriate EMS and HCA personnel. When dictated by circumstances of the event, initiate the EMS Emergency Response plan to an appropriate level.
