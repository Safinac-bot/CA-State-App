## I. STANDING ORDER: ADULT AMA

### Patient Rights

1. A capable adult, legal guardian, or an emancipated minor may refuse:
   - Specific EMS medical evaluation and care (example: establishment of an IV)
   - All EMS medical care indicated
   - Transport to an emergency receiving facility

### When AMA Does Not Apply

2. When both EMS personnel and the patient or legal guardian/care giver agree that medical evaluation and/or transport is not necessary, refer to **SO-REL** (Release procedures).

### AMA Process When Care/Transport Indicated

3. If a patient or legal guardian decides to sign out or leave AMA when EMS medical care or transport is indicated:

   **a. Communicate Risks**
   - Clearly explain the potential risks and consequences of refusal of care to the patient or legal guardian
   - Document this communication thoroughly

   **b. Present Alternatives**
   - Offer alternatives for obtaining care/transport
   - Discuss modification of services offered
   - Provide options for follow-up care

### Base Hospital Contact Requirements

4. Contact the Base Hospital for patients signing out AMA that meet Base Hospital contact criteria (OCEMS Policy #310.00).
   - If the patient refuses treatment and/or transport
   - AND there is some question regarding the decision-making capacity of the patient
   - Base Hospital consultation should be obtained

### Mental Health Considerations

5. When a patient exhibits signs of being a danger to self or others, or is gravely disabled due to a mental condition and cannot simply be treated and/or transported:
   - Notify law enforcement
   - Remain with the patient until law enforcement has made a determination regarding legal detention (5150 hold)
   - Do not leave patient unattended

### Ethical Considerations

6. It is **NOT appropriate** to dissuade or coerce a patient into signing AMA as a means to release in the field rather than transport for medical evaluation.
   - Patient autonomy must be respected
   - Coercion invalidates informed refusal
   - Document objective findings, not subjective opinions

---

## II. STANDING ORDER: UNDER AGE OF CONSENT (LESS THAN 18 YEARS-OLD) AMA

### General Principle

Patients less than 18 years-old and not emancipated minors who are offered EMS transport from the field may decline that offer when **ALL** of the following criteria are met:

### Required Criteria (ALL Must Be Met)

**a. Medical Assessment Complete**
- A paramedic primary and secondary exam along with vital signs confirm that:
  - No medical emergency exists for the minor
  - No psychiatric emergency exists for the minor
  - No EMT or paramedic treatment/intervention is indicated

**b. Parent/Guardian Contact**
- The minor's parent or legal guardian has been contacted OR is present at the scene
- AND the parent/guardian does not request EMS services and/or declines EMS transport

**Exceptions:**
- If the parent or legal guardian is **not available**, a self-sufficient minor may still be released at scene after all appropriate attempts are made and documented to locate the parent or legal guardian (see SO-REL)
- A minor who is **not self-sufficient** may still be released if a responsible adult is present (see SO-REL)

**c. Parent/Guardian Understanding**
- The parent or legal guardian, if available, has been advised
- AND communicates they understand that they may seek further assessment from a health care provider

**d. Scene Safety**
- The scene and situation in which the minor is being left is not a threat to their health and personal safety

### Special Case: Infant Fever

2. **Base hospital contact is required** for a patient less than 60 days old with a fever when the parents or legal guardians wish to sign out AMA.
   - This is a high-risk situation
   - Medical evaluation strongly recommended
   - Base Hospital must be contacted regardless of parent preference

### When Minor Cannot Sign AMA

3. If the parent or legal guardian is unavailable or cannot be contacted:
   - A non-emancipated minor **CANNOT** sign out AMA
   - The minor **MUST be transported** if an emergency medical or psychiatric condition may exist

   **a. If Patient Continues to Refuse Transport:**
   - Request help from law enforcement
   - Should law enforcement decline to intervene, make Base Hospital contact
   - Document all attempts to secure appropriate care

---

## III. DOCUMENTATION

### Required Documentation

**All AMA cases must have appropriate AMA documentation entered into the OC-MEDS ePCR** with the patient's signature (when patient capable and agrees to sign).

### Documentation Elements Should Include:

1. **Assessment findings:**
   - Chief complaint
   - Vital signs
   - Physical examination findings
   - Mental status assessment

2. **Risks communicated:**
   - Specific risks discussed with patient/guardian
   - Patient's understanding of those risks

3. **Alternatives offered:**
   - What alternatives were presented
   - Patient's response to alternatives

4. **Patient decision-making capacity:**
   - Alert and oriented status
   - Ability to understand circumstances
   - Judgment assessment

5. **Signature:**
   - Patient signature if capable and willing
   - Witness signature
   - If patient refuses to sign, document refusal

6. **Base Hospital contact:**
   - If applicable, document time of contact
   - Name of physician consulted
   - Recommendations provided

7. **Scene safety assessment:**
   - For minors: document scene/situation safety
   - For adults: document patient will be in safe environment

Sign ePCR       if appropriate
```

### Pediatric AMA Decision Tree

```
Minor refuses care/transport
         ↓
All criteria met? (assessment, parent contact, understanding, safety)
    ↓           ↓
   YES          NO
    ↓           ↓
Parent present?  Must transport
    ↓           ↓
   YES          Base Hospital
    ↓           contact if
Document AMA    parent refuses
Parent signs    
```

## VI. SPECIAL SITUATIONS

### Intoxicated Patients

**Cannot sign AMA** - Intoxication impairs decision-making capacity
- Base Hospital contact required
- Consider law enforcement involvement
- May require involuntary transport if danger to self/others

### Head Injury

**Use caution with AMA** - Even if patient appears alert
- Consider altered mental status developing later
- Base Hospital contact strongly recommended
- Document detailed neuro exam

### Psychiatric Patients

**High-risk for AMA**
- Assess for danger to self/others
- Consider 5150 hold if criteria met
- Base Hospital contact recommended
- Law enforcement may be needed

### Language Barriers

**Ensure true informed refusal**
- Use qualified interpreter (not family member if possible)
- Document interpreter used
- Ensure patient truly understands risks

### Homeless/Vulnerable Populations

**Extra care needed**
- Assess for safe environment
- Offer resources for follow-up care
- Social services notification may be appropriate
- Document scene/environment carefully

## VII. BASE HOSPITAL CONTACT INDICATIONS FOR AMA

Contact Base Hospital when:

1. Patient's decision-making capacity is questionable
2. High-risk medical condition exists (chest pain, stroke symptoms, severe trauma)
3. Infant < 60 days old with fever
4. Parent/guardian refuses transport for minor with concerning findings
5. Law enforcement declines to intervene in mental health situation
6. Any uncertainty about appropriateness of AMA
7. Patient meets criteria in OCEMS Policy #310.00

---

## VIII. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Patient Autonomy

- Capable adults have the right to refuse care
- Must be truly informed refusal
- Coercion invalidates consent/refusal

### Duty to Act vs. Patient Rights

- EMS has duty to offer appropriate care
- Patient has right to refuse
- Balance requires clear communication and documentation

### Protection from Liability

**Best protection includes:**
1. Thorough assessment and documentation
2. Clear communication of risks
3. Offering alternatives
4. Base Hospital contact when appropriate
5. Involving law enforcement when safety concerns exist

### When in Doubt

- **Transport the patient**
- Contact Base Hospital
- Involve supervisor
- Better to err on side of patient safety
