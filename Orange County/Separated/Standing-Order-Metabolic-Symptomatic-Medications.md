## Hypoglycemia Management Guidelines

### Recognition

#### Symptoms:
- Altered mental status
- Diaphoresis
- Tremor
- Palpitations
- Hunger
- Weakness
- Seizures

#### Risk Factors:
- Diabetic on insulin or oral agents
- Missed meals
- Excessive exercise
- Alcohol consumption
- Renal failure

### Treatment Algorithm

1. **Check blood glucose**

2. **If < 60 mg/dL:**
   - Alert and able to swallow → **Oral glucose**
   - IV access → **Dextrose 10%**
   - No IV access → **Glucagon IM** (see Emergency/Reversal Medications)

3. **Recheck in 10-15 minutes**

4. **Repeat treatment** if still low

5. **Give complex carbohydrates** when alert

6. **Transport** for evaluation

### Post-Treatment Care

#### Complex Carbohydrates:
- Crackers with peanut butter
- Sandwich
- Granola bar
- Meal if available

#### Patient Education:
- Check blood glucose regularly
- Don't skip meals
- Adjust insulin if exercising
- Avoid alcohol on empty stomach
- Keep glucose source available

#### Causes to Investigate:
- Medication errors (too much insulin)
- Missed meals
- New medication interactions
- Illness/infection
- Renal failure
- Alcohol use

#### Formulation 1: 2% Solution for IO Pain
**Form:** 2% solution  
**Route:** IO (Intraosseous)
