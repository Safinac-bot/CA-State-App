## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**XXX BASE HOSPITAL CONTACT REQUIRED XXX**

**All patient care is directed by the Base Hospital.**

This is a highly specialized patient population requiring Base Hospital guidance throughout the resuscitation.

---

## Understanding LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device)

### What is an LVAD?

An **LVAD** is a mechanical pump that helps the heart pump blood to the body. It is implanted in patients with severe heart failure.

**Key Components:**
- **Internal pump** - surgically implanted in chest
- **Driveline** - cable exiting through abdominal wall
- **Controller** - external computer that runs the pump
- **Power source** - batteries or AC power

**Patient Population:**
- Severe heart failure
- Bridge to heart transplant
- Destination therapy (permanent)
- Bridge to recovery

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONCEPT: Traditional Vital Signs May Not Work

**Because of continuous flow LVAD:**
- **NO PALPABLE PULSE** (or very weak pulse)
- **NO BLOOD PRESSURE** by auscultation or palpation
- **Pulse oximetry may not work** (no pulse wave detected)
- **ECG shows native heart rhythm** (may not reflect perfusion)

**YOU CANNOT USE TRADITIONAL VITAL SIGNS TO ASSESS THESE PATIENTS**

---

## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Initial Assessment and LVAD Coordinator Contact

**Assess patient and establish telephone contact with the patient's Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) coordinator to plan management.**

**However, all patient care is directed by the Base Hospital.**

**Key Points:**
- LVAD coordinator can help assess device function
- LVAD coordinator can interpret alarms
- **Only Base Hospital can give treatment orders**
- LVAD coordinator is a resource, not medical control

**Upon arrival, the patient or caregiver will likely be in telephone contact with the LVAD program coordinator.**

**LVAD Automatic Paramedic Alarms may be set up to alert both 911 and the patient's LVAD coordinators.**

---

### 2. CPR Decision for Apneic/Unresponsive Patient

**If patient is apneic and unresponsive or unconscious:**

**►Initiate CPR (including chest compressions)**

**YES - You CAN and SHOULD do chest compressions on LVAD patients if they are:**
- Apneic (not breathing)
- Unresponsive or unconscious

**Why Chest Compressions are Safe:**
- LVAD is designed to withstand compressions
- Native heart function may still be present
- Compressions improve flow through LVAD
- Benefits outweigh risks

**Some LVAD devices are equipped with an alarm and red heart-shaped LED indicator that will flash or become visible with an audible alarm when CPR is indicated (pump failure).**

---

### 3. Assessing Perfusion Without Traditional Vital Signs

**Vital sign measurements may be misleading or not possible to measure.**

**Indications of hypotension or reduced circulatory (cardiac) function include:**

- **Altered level of consciousness**
- **Syncope, near-syncope, dizziness**
- **Dyspnea** (shortness of breath)
- **Nausea, vomiting**
- **Poor skin perfusion signs, diaphoresis**

**How to Assess LVAD Patients:**
- Mental status (MOST IMPORTANT)
- Skin signs (color, temperature, moisture)
- Respiratory effort
- End-tidal CO₂ (if intubated)
- Symptoms reported by patient
- LVAD alarms and display
- Ask LVAD coordinator about pump parameters

---

### 4. Base Hospital Contact and Destination

**Contact Base Hospital for further orders and CVRC destination.**

**Required for:**
- ALL LVAD emergencies
- Treatment guidance
- Device troubleshooting assistance
- CVRC destination coordination

**CVRC (Cardiovascular Receiving Center) Required:**
- These facilities have cardiac surgery capability
- May have LVAD expertise
- Can manage complex device issues
- Base Hospital will determine appropriate destination

---

### 5. Fluid Resuscitation

**For hypotension with lungs clear and no signs of CHF/pulmonary edema:**

**► Normal Saline, infuse 250 mL, may repeat 3 times (total 1 liter) to maintain perfusion.**

**Indications:**
- Signs of poor perfusion (see step 3)
- Lungs clear to auscultation
- No signs of CHF/pulmonary edema

**Cautions:**
- LVAD patients often have history of severe CHF
- Can develop pulmonary edema quickly
- Auscultate lungs before and after each bolus
- Monitor for worsening respiratory status

**Note:** "Hypotension" is assessed by clinical signs of poor perfusion, not BP measurement (which may not be possible).

---

### 6. Hypoglycemia Management

**For altered level of consciousness or unresponsiveness, consider obtaining blood glucose:**

**Adult/Adolescent:** Treat a blood glucose of 60 or less using an option listed below. If hypoglycemia is suspected and blood glucose is in the range of 60 to 80, treatment based on field impression is appropriate.

**Treatment Options:**

**► Oral glucose preparation, if airway reflexes are intact.**

**☑ 10% Dextrose 250 mL IV/IO (titrated for effect to improve consciousness).**

**Glucagon 1 mg IM if unable to establish IV.**

**Why Check Glucose:**
- Altered mental status may be from hypoglycemia, not LVAD malfunction
- Easy to check and treat
- Don't assume all altered mental status is device-related

---

### 7. Standard Resuscitation Measures

**Routine resuscitation measures apply including medications and defibrillation.**

**The Base Hospital will assist in guiding the resuscitation.**

**Standard ACLS Applies:**
- Medications (epinephrine, amiodarone, etc.)
- Defibrillation if indicated (VF/pulseless VT)
- Airway management
- IV/IO access
- All standard cardiac arrest interventions

**Special Considerations:**
- May have ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF)
- Can still have native heart electrical activity
- Defibrillation is safe with LVAD
- Apply pads away from device if possible
- Follow standard cardiac arrest algorithms with Base guidance

---

### 8. Equipment and Caregiver Transport

**Transport LVAD supporting equipment and caregiver trained in LVAD operation to the CVRC with the patient.**

**MUST Transport:**
- **LVAD controller** (usually attached to patient)
- **Backup controller** (if available)
- **Power supplies** (batteries, AC adapter)
- **All cables and equipment**
- **LVAD information card** (usually with patient)
- **Emergency contact numbers**

**Transport LVAD-Trained Caregiver:**
- Often family member trained in device
- Can assist with device management
- Knows patient's baseline
- Has LVAD coordinator contact info
- Critical resource for receiving facility

**Do NOT Disconnect Equipment:**
- Keep patient connected to power at all times
- Use batteries during transport
- Never disconnect driveline
- Protect equipment during transport

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### Scene Size-Up and Initial Approach

#### Upon Arrival:

**Two-Paramedic Team Approach:**

**Upon arrival of a two paramedic team:**
- **Have one member assess the patient**
- **Have other member initiate or continue telephone contact with patient LVAD coordinator to plan management**

**Providers may only take orders from the Base Hospital, not the LVAD Coordinator**

**LVAD Coordinator Role:**
- Assesses device function remotely
- Interprets alarms
- Provides technical information
- Assists in troubleshooting
- **NOT medical control** (only Base Hospital)

---

### Initial Patient Assessment with LVAD Coordinator

**During initial patient assessment, the LVAD coordinator may assist in determining the cardiac output and the function of the LVAD.**

**Information LVAD Coordinator Can Provide:**
- Device settings and parameters
- Flow rates
- Power levels
- Recent alarms or issues
- Patient's baseline status
- Recent device adjustments
- Known device problems

**Questions to Ask LVAD Coordinator:**
- Is the device functioning normally?
- What are current flow parameters?
- Are there any active alarms?
- What is patient's baseline status?
- Any recent issues with device?
- What should we monitor specifically?

---

### Understanding Vital Sign Limitations

**Depending on the remaining function of the native heart, several vital sign measurements will be misleading or not possible to measure:**

#### Pulses
**Peripheral and central pulses may be weak or absent.**

**Why:**
- LVAD provides continuous flow (not pulsatile)
- No pulse wave generated
- May have faint pulse from native heart if any function remains

**What to Do:**
- Don't rely on pulse assessment
- Use other perfusion indicators
- Document "LVAD patient - pulse assessment not reliable"

---

#### Blood Pressure
**Auscultated and palpated BP may not be possible.**

**Why:**
- Continuous flow prevents Korotkoff sounds
- No pulsatile pressure wave
- Standard BP cuffs don't work

**What to Do:**
- Use clinical perfusion indicators instead
- May be able to get Doppler BP (mean arterial pressure)
- Some EMS units have Doppler capability
- Document "LVAD patient - standard BP not obtainable"

---

#### Pulse Oximetry
**Pulse oximetry may not record a pulse wave and may underestimate SpO₂.**

**Why:**
- Requires pulsatile flow to detect
- May not get waveform
- Reading may be inaccurate

**What to Do:**
- Attempt pulse oximetry
- If reading obtained, use cautiously
- Look at waveform quality
- Use other indicators of oxygenation (skin color, mental status, respiratory effort)
- Capnography if intubated

---

#### ECG
**ECG may show the rate & rhythm of the native heart.**

**Why:**
- ECG shows electrical activity
- Native heart still has electrical system
- May not reflect actual perfusion

**What to Do:**
- Obtain ECG
- May see arrhythmias (VT, VF, AFib common)
- Rhythm may look normal despite poor perfusion
- Or may look abnormal with adequate LVAD function
- Clinical assessment more important than rhythm

---

### LVAD Device Assessment

#### LVAD Controller and Alarms

**Most LVAD systems have:**
- Digital display screen
- Alarm indicators
- Flow parameters
- Power status
- Battery level

**Common Alarms:**
- **Low flow** - obstruction or hypovolemia
- **High flow** - disconnection or system issue  
- **Low battery** - power issue
- **System malfunction** - device problem
- **CPR alarm** - red heart LED, pump failure

**Response to Alarms:**
- Note which alarms are active
- Relay information to LVAD coordinator
- Check power connections
- Ensure batteries are connected
- Don't attempt to silence or troubleshoot without guidance

---

### Common LVAD Emergencies

**Common emergencies in LVAD patients include:**

#### GI Bleed & Epistaxis
**From anticoagulation**

- LVAD patients on anticoagulation (blood thinners)
- Prevents clots in device
- High risk for bleeding
- GI bleeding common
- Nosebleeds can be severe

**Management:**
- Control external bleeding if possible
- Rapid transport
- Fluid resuscitation if hypotensive
- Notify receiving facility

---

#### Stroke (Ischemic & Hemorrhagic)

- Increased risk for both types
- Clot formation in device → ischemic stroke
- Anticoagulation → hemorrhagic stroke
- May see stroke symptoms

**Management:**
- Rapid neuro assessment
- Stroke protocol/scale
- Rapid transport to stroke center (coordinate with Base)
- Time critical

---

#### LVAD Hardware & Systemic Infection

- Driveline penetrates skin → infection risk
- Can develop serious infections
- Sepsis risk
- Device infection

**Signs:**
- Fever
- Altered mental status
- Signs of sepsis
- Redness around driveline exit site

**Management:**
- Supportive care
- Fluid resuscitation if indicated
- Rapid transport
- CVRC destination

---

#### Equipment Malfunction

**The patient, caregiver or LVAD coordinator can help assess the equipment and any alarms**

**Types of Malfunctions:**
- Power failure (batteries dead)
- Controller malfunction
- Pump failure
- Driveline disconnection or damage
- Alarms indicating problems

**Management:**
- Contact LVAD coordinator immediately
- Use backup controller if available
- Check all power connections
- Ensure batteries connected
- Transport all equipment
- CPR if patient unresponsive/apneic (pump failure alarm)

---
