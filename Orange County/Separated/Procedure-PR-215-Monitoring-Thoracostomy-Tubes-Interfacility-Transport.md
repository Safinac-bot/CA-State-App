## PROCEDURE

- Monitor vital signs and cardiac rhythm.

- Pulse oximetry, if oxygen saturation less than 95% on room air, provide oxygen by mask or nasal cannula (6 L/m flow rate).

- Assure all chest tube connections are taped and secured to prevent disconnection.

- Do not clamp or kink chest tube or drainage tubing.

- Hang collection chamber on the side of the gurney (do not tip over).

- Keep collection chamber below the level of the chest.

- Avoid dependent loops of fluid filling drainage tubing.

- If chest tube is pulled out, place petroleum gauze dressing over insertion site.

- If air leaks, check connections.

- If chest tube partially pulled out:
  - Do not push tube back into chest.
  - Secure tube as is at the site.

- If patients become dyspneic:
  - Assess breath sounds.
  - Contact Base (needle thoracostomy may need to be done).

- Notify receiving center if any complications occur during transport.

- Document:
  1. Any difficulties or complications during transport.
  2. Patient's response.
