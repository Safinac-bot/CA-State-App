## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Oxygen Therapy for Enclosed Space or Heavy Smoke

**For any burn injury occurring in an enclosed space or with heavy smoke generated at the site:**

**High flow oxygen by mask as tolerated**

**(Pulse oximetry may be inaccurate with smoke inhalation).**

**Why:** Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin and pulse oximeter cannot differentiate CO from oxygen - may show normal SpO₂ despite severe CO poisoning.

**Indications:**
- Burns in enclosed space
- Heavy smoke exposure
- Suspected smoke inhalation
- Any respiratory symptoms

---

### 2. Cooling Measures

**Apply cooling measures if burn still symptomatic.**

**Method:**
- Cool, clean water or saline
- Room temperature (NOT ice)
- 10-20 minutes or until pain improved
- Stop if patient becomes cold

**Cautions:**
- Don't use ice water (worsens tissue damage)
- Don't cool large areas extensively (hypothermia risk)
- Cover after cooling to prevent heat loss

---

### 3. Bronchodilator for Wheezing/Smoke Inhalation

**For wheezing or suspected smoke inhalation:**

**Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated.**

**Indications:**
- Wheezing
- Suspected smoke inhalation
- Dyspnea
- Stridor
- Facial burns with singed nasal hairs
- Carbonaceous sputum

---

### 4. Pain Management

**For pain, if BP greater than 90 systolic** (do not inject medication or establish IV through burned skin areas):

**Option 1: Morphine Sulfate**

**►Morphine sulfate 5 mg (or 4 mg carpuject) IV/IM or IO (if already established for saline infusion), may repeat once in 3 minutes to control pain;**

**Option 2: Fentanyl**

**OR**

**Fentanyl 50 mcg IV/IM or Fentanyl 100 mcg IN, may repeat once in 3 minutes to control pain.**

**Requirements:**
- BP > 90 systolic
- Avoid burned skin for IV/injection
- May repeat ONCE after 3 minutes
- Monitor respiratory status

---

### 5. Fluid Resuscitation for Shock

**For blood pressure ≤ 90 or signs of shock** (do not establish IV through burned skin areas):

**Establish IV access in non-burned area of skin**

**► Infuse 250 mL Normal Saline bolus, may repeat up to maximum 1 liter to maintain adequate perfusion.**

**Indications:**
- BP ≤ 90
- Signs of shock (altered mental status, poor perfusion, tachycardia)

**IV Access:**
- Establish in NON-BURNED area if possible
- May use burned skin if necessary
- Consider IO if difficult

**Fluid Protocol:**
- 250 mL NS bolus
- May repeat up to 1 liter total
- Reassess after each bolus

---

---

#### TOTAL BURN SURFACE AREA (TBSA):

**Second degree burns >10% TBSA in any age group**

**Any third degree burn**

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### Carbon Monoxide (CO) Toxicity

**Suspected with:** Closed space burn, smoke inhalation, chemical fires

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Pulse oximetry O₂ saturation will be inaccurate due to inability of pulse oximeter to differentiate between carbon monoxide and oxygen molecule.**

**Management:**
- High-flow oxygen (100%) regardless of pulse ox reading
- Non-rebreather at 15 L/min
- Continue throughout transport
- Notify receiving facility

**Clinical Signs:**
- Headache, dizziness, confusion
- Nausea, weakness
- Altered mental status
- Loss of consciousness

---

### Chemical Burns

**→ Brush away any remaining dry chemical.**

**→ Irrigate burn wound and surrounding skin with copious and continuous water or saline flush to dilute and remove as much residual chemical as possible.**

**Management Steps:**
1. Brush away dry chemical (before water)
2. Copious water or saline irrigation
3. Continue for at least 20-30 minutes
4. Remove all contaminated clothing
5. Irrigate surrounding skin
6. May need to continue irrigation en route

**Eyes:** Irrigate for minimum 20 minutes if involved

#### ⚠️ SPECIAL WARNING:

**o NOTE: Some chemicals are activated by water and might worsen the burn or create hazardous fumes; e.g., sodium, phosphorus, acetyl bromide, aluminum carbide, silicon tetrachloride.**

**Water-Reactive Chemicals:**
- Sodium, phosphorus (may ignite)
- Acetyl bromide (toxic fumes)
- Aluminum carbide (flammable gas)
- Silicon tetrachloride (HCl gas)

**If water-reactive suspected:**
- Scene safety first
- Request HazMat
- Brush away dry chemical
- Base Hospital contact
- Specialized burn unit

---

### Electrical Burns

**→ Electrical burns may often appear insignificant while causing marked muscle and soft tissue damage.**

**"Iceberg" Injury:**
- Small surface wounds
- Massive internal damage
- Muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis)
- Vascular injury
- Compartment syndrome risk

**→ Cardiac irritability may occur with electrical burns.**

**Dysrhythmias Possible:**
- VF/VT (immediate or delayed)
- Atrial fibrillation
- Heart blocks
- Asystole

**→ High voltage, greater than 500-1000 volts, alternating current burn victims should be transported with ALS escort and cardiac rhythm monitoring** (contact Base Hospital for available Burn Unit).

**Assessment:**
- Look for entry AND exit wounds
- Document location of both
- Check pulses distal to injury
- Cardiac monitoring (all electrical burns)
- Watch for dark urine (rhabdomyolysis)

**Lightning Injuries:**
- Extremely high voltage
- Cardiac arrest common
- All need cardiac monitoring
- Burn Unit destination

---

## Quick Burn Assessment

### Rule of Nines (Adult)
- **Head/Neck:** 9% | **Each Arm:** 9% | **Anterior Trunk:** 18%
- **Posterior Trunk:** 18% | **Each Leg:** 18% | **Genitalia:** 1%
- **Alternative:** Patient's palm = ~1% TBSA

### Burn Depth
- **1st Degree:** Red, no blisters (like sunburn)
- **2nd Degree:** Blistered, painful → **Burn Unit if >10% TBSA**
- **3rd Degree:** White/black/leathery, painless → **Burn Unit for ANY**

### Inhalation Injury Red Flags
✓ Enclosed space | ✓ Facial burns | ✓ **Singed nasal hairs**
✓ **Carbonaceous sputum** | ✓ **Hoarseness** | ✓ Stridor

### Circumferential Burns (Burn Unit Criteria)
- Encircles extremity, chest, or neck
- **Risk:** Compartment syndrome, respiratory restriction
- **Action:** Check distal pulses frequently, rapid transport

---

## Clinical Decision Support

### Do I Need Base Hospital for Burn Unit?

**YES - Contact Base Hospital if ANY:**

**Mechanism:**
- □ Inhalation injury suspected
- □ Electrical burn (any voltage)
- □ Chemical burn
- □ Lightning injury

**Location:**
- □ Face
- □ Hands
- □ Feet
- □ Genitalia/perineum
- □ Circumferential (extremity, chest, neck)

**Extent:**
- □ 2nd degree >10% TBSA
- □ ANY 3rd degree burn

**Patient:**
- □ Significant comorbidities (DM, renal/cardiac/pulmonary disease)

**If NONE of above → Nearest ERC**

---

### High Voltage Electrical Burn?

**High Voltage = >500-1000 volts**

**Requirements:**
- ALS escort
- Continuous cardiac monitoring
- Contact Base Hospital for Burn Unit

**Even if wounds look small:**
- Massive internal damage likely
- Path through body = organs damaged
- Cardiac irritability
- Rhabdomyolysis
- Monitor urine color

---

### Smoke Inhalation Management

**Give High-Flow Oxygen REGARDLESS of Pulse Ox**

**Why:**
- CO binds to hemoglobin
- Pulse ox reads COHb as oxygen
- May show 98-100% with severe CO poisoning
- ALWAYS give oxygen if smoke exposure

**Plus:**
- Albuterol continuous nebulization
- Monitor airway for swelling
- Watch for hoarseness, stridor
- Prepare for intubation

✓ **Inhalation injury = Burn Unit** - singed hairs, soot, hoarseness  
✓ **Electrical burns: small wounds, BIG damage** - always ALS monitor  
✓ **Chemical: brush then irrigate** (except water-reactive)  
✓ **>10% TBSA 2nd degree = Burn Unit**  
✓ **ANY 3rd degree = Burn Unit**  
✓ **Face/hands/feet/genitalia = Burn Unit**  
✓ **Circumferential = Burn Unit** - compartment syndrome risk  
✓ **Avoid burned skin for IV** if possible  
✓ **Base Hospital contact** determines Burn Unit destination
