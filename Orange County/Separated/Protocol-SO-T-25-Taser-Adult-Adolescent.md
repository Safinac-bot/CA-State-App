---

### 2. Barbs Embedded in Sensitive Areas

Barbs embedded in the face, eye, hand, foot, or groin should be left in place and patient transported to nearest ERC.

---

### 3. Assess Victim's Pulse:

**A. If pulse regular, vital signs are stable, patient mentally competent and not requesting transport for medical evaluation:**

1. May return (without transport) to custody of law enforcement with recommendation that, "individual be medically screened at intake or an emergency department", and document conversation on PCR.

**B. If pulse irregular, vital signs unstable, or victim exhibits signs of altered mental status or toxic delirium:**

1. **Cardiac monitor if patient cooperative, and document rhythm with strip,**

2. **Treat symptomatic bradycardia or unstable tachycardia using Cardiac SO-C-20 (Bradycardia) or SO-C-25 (Narrow Complex Tachycardia).**

**Obtain pulse oximetry and if oxygen saturation less than 95%, administer oxygen:**

**► High-flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 l/min flow rate as tolerated.**

3. **Blood glucose analysis, if blood glucose less than 80, administer one of:**

**► Oral glucose preparation, if tolerated and airway reflexes are intact.**

**10% Dextrose 250 mL IV**

**Glucagon 1 mg IM if unable to establish IV.**

**Note:** IO access may be used for dextrose administration when patient is unconscious with blood glucose < 80, unable to establish IV and there is no response to IM glucagon.

4. **If presenting in a state of toxic delirium, transport immediately to nearest ERC. If agitation interferes with loading for transport give:**

**☑ Midazolam 5 mg IM/IV/IN once for sedation (assist ventilation and support airway if respiratory depression develops).**

**Venous access, if can be safely established, and give 250 mL Normal Saline fluid bolus, continue Normal Saline as a wide open infusion to attain or maintain perfusion (palpable radial pulse, good skin signs, and appropriate mental status).**
