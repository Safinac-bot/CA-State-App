## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. General Management

**→ Pulse oximetry, if oxygen saturation less than 95%, administer one of following based on tolerance or condition:**

**High-flow Oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow rate if tolerated**

**► If history of COPD, Oxygen by nasal cannula 2 liters/minute.**

**Do not withhold oxygen therapy for a COPD patient if severely hypoxic as manifested by struggling to breath and physical respiratory distress (O₂ Sat is unreliable to assess COPD distress in the acute field setting). Treat COPD patients with acute respiratory distress with O₂ and prepare to assist ventilation as needed.**

**→ Monitor cardiac rhythm.**

---

### 2. Specific Conditions - Treat As Noted

**In addition to the above, if one of the following conditions exists, treat as noted:**

---

## CONDITION 1: Congestive Heart Failure / Pulmonary Edema

**Bilateral basilar rales, labored breathing (RR > 20/min) and suspected congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema:**

### Nitroglycerin Administration:

**► If systolic BP ≥ 100 mm Hg, administer Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL, may repeat twice if BP remains ≥ 100 mm Hg.**

**OR,**

**If systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg, administer Nitroglycerin 0.8 mg SL, may repeat twice if BP remains ≥ 150 mm Hg (if drops below 150 mm Hg, but remains above 100 mm Hg, continue with 0.4 mg SL dosing).**

**Nitroglycerin Dosing Strategy:**

**If BP 100-149 mm Hg:**
- Give 0.4 mg SL
- May repeat twice (every 3-5 min)
- Total maximum: 3 doses (1.2 mg)
- Must remain ≥ 100 systolic

**If BP ≥ 150 mm Hg:**
- Give 0.8 mg SL (double dose)
- May repeat twice
- If BP drops below 150 but stays >100: switch to 0.4 mg doses
- Monitor BP closely

---

### CPAP:

**CPAP if available as tolerated and if not contraindicated (reference PR-120).**

- Apply CPAP per procedure guideline
- Typically 5-10 cm H₂O
- High-flow oxygen
- Improves oxygenation
- Reduces work of breathing
- May prevent intubation

---

### 12-Lead ECG:

**12-lead ECG, if "Acute MI" indicated or a STEMI is suspected based on paramedic interpretation of 12-lead ECG contact Base Hospital for CVRC destination.**

- CHF may be caused by acute MI
- Obtain 12-lead
- If STEMI identified: Base Hospital contact
- CVRC destination if STEMI

---

**→ ALS escort to nearest appropriate ERC.**

---

## CONDITION 2: Stridor

**Stridor (if suspected allergic reaction, refer to SO-M-15):**

**► Place in position of comfort and ALS escort to nearest appropriate ERC.**

**Stridor Considerations:**
- Upper airway obstruction
- Inspiratory high-pitched sound
- May be allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
- May be infection (croup, epiglottitis)
- May be foreign body
- May be trauma

**If Allergic:** Refer to SO-M-15 (Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis protocol)

**Management:**
- Position of comfort (usually sitting upright)
- High-flow oxygen
- Do NOT force patient to lie down
- Do NOT agitate patient
- Prepare for complete obstruction
- Rapid transport
- ALS escort

---

## CONDITION 3: Wheezing / Bronchospasm

**Wheezes, suspected asthma or other forms of bronchospasm, including COPD:**

**► Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6.0 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated. If no improvement, consider BH contact for IM epinephrine order.**

**Albuterol Administration:**
- Continuous nebulization
- 6.0 mL (5 mg concentration)
- Deliver with oxygen
- Continue throughout assessment and transport
- Most patients will improve

**If No Improvement:**
- Consider Base Hospital contact
- May order IM epinephrine for severe bronchospasm
- Epinephrine 0.3-0.5 mg IM
- Especially if suspected anaphylaxis component

---

**CPAP if available as tolerated and if not contraindicated (reference PR-120).**

- May help severe asthma/COPD
- Reduces work of breathing
- Improves oxygenation
- Use with caution in severe bronchospasm

---

**→ ALS escort to nearest appropriate ERC.**

---

### 3. Base Hospital Contact

**If further orders required for patient stabilization, contact Base Hospital.**

**Consider Base Hospital for:**
- Deteriorating patient despite treatment
- Need for additional medications
- Questions about management
- Severe respiratory distress not improving
- Need for advanced airway
- Destination questions

---

## COPD Oxygen Management

**Traditional Teaching (Outdated):**
- Don't give high-flow oxygen to COPD
- May suppress hypoxic drive
- Keep SpO₂ 88-92%

**Current Protocol:**
- **Do NOT withhold oxygen if severely hypoxic**
- COPD patients struggling to breathe NEED oxygen
- Pulse ox unreliable in acute COPD exacerbation
- Physical respiratory distress = give oxygen
- Prepare to assist ventilation if needed

**Why This Changed:**
- Hypoxia kills faster than hypercapnia
- Can always assist ventilation
- Cannot reverse hypoxic brain injury
- Patient distress indicates need

**Guidelines:**
- Start with 2 L/min nasal cannula (if mild distress)
- If severe distress: give oxygen as needed
- Titrate to patient condition, not just SpO₂
- Monitor respiratory rate and effort
- Be prepared to assist ventilation with BVM

---

## CHF / Pulmonary Edema Recognition

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- **Bilateral basilar rales** (crackles in lung bases)
- Labored breathing
- Respiratory rate > 20/min
- Orthopnea (can't lie flat)
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (wakes up SOB)
- Peripheral edema (swollen ankles)
- Jugular venous distension (JVD)
- Pink, frothy sputum (severe)
- History of CHF, MI, hypertension

**Pathophysiology:**
- Left heart failure
- Blood backs up into lungs
- Fluid leaks into alveoli
- Impaired gas exchange

**Treatment Goals:**
- Reduce preload (nitroglycerin)
- Improve oxygenation (oxygen, CPAP)
- Reduce work of breathing (positioning, CPAP)
- Rule out MI (12-lead)

---

## Nitroglycerin (NTG) Use in CHF

**Mechanism:**
- Vasodilator (veins more than arteries)
- Reduces preload
- Reduces fluid backup to lungs
- Reduces work of heart

**Dosing:**
- 0.4 mg if BP 100-149
- 0.8 mg if BP ≥ 150
- Sublingual (under tongue)
- May repeat every 3-5 minutes
- Maximum 3 doses

**Blood Pressure Monitoring:**
- Check BP before each dose
- Must stay ≥ 100 systolic
- If drops below 100: stop NTG
- If drops below 150 but stays >100: decrease to 0.4 mg

**Contraindications:**
- Systolic BP < 100
- Recent sildenafil/tadalafil use (Viagra, Cialis)
- Inferior MI with right ventricular involvement
- Severe aortic stenosis

**Side Effects:**
- Headache (common, expected)
- Hypotension
- Reflex tachycardia

---

## CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)

**Mechanism:**
- Positive pressure throughout respiratory cycle
- Recruits collapsed alveoli
- Pushes fluid back into circulation
- Reduces work of breathing
- Improves oxygenation

**Indications:**
- CHF/pulmonary edema
- Severe respiratory distress
- Hypoxia despite oxygen
- Patient conscious and cooperative

**Contraindications:**
- Unconscious/cannot protect airway
- Vomiting
- Facial trauma
- Pneumothorax (untreated)
- Hypotension

**Settings:**
- Typically 5-10 cm H₂O PEEP
- High-flow oxygen (near 100%)
- Tight mask seal required
- Patient must tolerate

**Benefits:**
- May prevent intubation
- Rapid improvement often seen
- Reduces hospital stay
- Non-invasive

**Reference:** PR-120 for full CPAP procedure

---

## Asthma / COPD / Bronchospasm

**Common Causes:**
- **Asthma** - reactive airway disease
- **COPD** - chronic bronchitis, emphysema
- **Allergic** - anaphylaxis component
- **Infection** - bronchitis, pneumonia
- **Cardiac** - "cardiac asthma" from CHF

**Wheezing:**
- Expiratory wheeze most common
- Musical, whistling sound
- Indicates bronchospasm
- May be silent chest if severe (ominous)

**Treatment:**
- **Albuterol** - bronchodilator
- Continuous nebulization
- Oxygen
- CPAP may help
- Position of comfort (usually sitting)

**Severe Asthma Signs:**
- Silent chest (no air movement)
- Unable to speak
- Tripod positioning
- Altered mental status
- Fatigue
- Consider impending respiratory arrest

---

## Stridor

**Definition:** High-pitched, inspiratory sound indicating upper airway obstruction

**Causes:**
- **Anaphylaxis** - tongue/throat swelling
- **Croup** - viral, barking cough
- **Epiglottitis** - bacterial, drooling
- **Foreign body** - choking
- **Trauma** - swelling from injury
- **Abscess** - peritonsillar, retropharyngeal

**Management:**
- Position of comfort (sitting)
- Do NOT force supine
- Do NOT agitate patient (worsens obstruction)
- High-flow oxygen
- If allergic: epinephrine per SO-M-15
- Prepare for complete obstruction
- Rapid transport

---

## Assessment Priorities

### Initial Assessment:
- **Airway:** Patent? Stridor?
- **Breathing:** Rate, depth, effort, sounds
- **Circulation:** HR, BP, perfusion
- **SpO₂:** Oxygen saturation

### Work of Breathing:
- Respiratory rate
- Use of accessory muscles
- Tripod positioning
- Ability to speak (full sentences vs words)
- Nasal flaring
- Retractions (intercostal, supraclavicular)

### Lung Sounds:
- **Wheezes** - bronchospasm
- **Rales/crackles** - CHF, pneumonia
- **Stridor** - upper airway obstruction
- **Diminished** - poor air movement, pneumothorax
- **Absent** - pneumothorax, severe disease

### History:
- Previous episodes
- Known lung disease (asthma, COPD, CHF)
- Medications (inhalers used?)
- Allergies
- Recent illness
- Chest pain

## Key Points

✓ **Oxygen for all if SpO₂ < 95%**  
✓ **COPD: Don't withhold oxygen** if severely hypoxic  
✓ **CHF: NTG** (0.4 mg if BP 100-149, 0.8 mg if BP ≥150)  
✓ **CHF: CPAP** if available and not contraindicated  
✓ **CHF: 12-lead** - rule out MI  
✓ **Stridor: Position of comfort** - ALS escort  
✓ **Wheezing: Albuterol** continuous neb  
✓ **No improvement: Consider BH** for IM epinephrine  
✓ **Monitor cardiac rhythm** on all  
✓ **Base Hospital** if further orders needed

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Withholding oxygen from COPD** - give if severely hypoxic  
❌ **NTG with low BP** - must be ≥ 100 systolic  
❌ **Forcing stridor patient supine** - worsens obstruction  
❌ **Not giving continuous albuterol** - should be ongoing  
❌ **Missing MI in CHF** - get 12-lead  
❌ **CPAP on vomiting patient** - aspiration risk
