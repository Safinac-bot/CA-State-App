## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Positioning

**Place in and transport in left lateral position.**

---

### 2. Base Hospital Contact and Transport

**ALS escort and contact Base Hospital to determine destination for OB capable ERC.**

---

### 3. Oxygenation and Ventilation

**Pulse oximetry and, if available, waveform capnography. If oxygen saturation less than 95%, administer:**

**High-flow Oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow rate as tolerated.**

**If end tidal CO₂ equals 50 or more:**

**Assist ventilation with BVM.**

---

### 4. Seizure Management

**For seizure activity:**

**Turn to left side, protect airway and suction when necessary.**

**Midazolam 10 mg IM one time (preferred route). Administer first before starting IV/IO.**

**Midazolam 5 mg IV/IN/IO if not able to deliver IM dose or if IV/IO already present, may repeat 5 mg IV/IN/IO once for continued or recurrent seizure activity approximately 3 minutes after initial dose.**

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

High blood pressure in a pregnant patient over 20 weeks gestation may be the result of pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia, which can lead to seizures, is a medical emergency, and all pregnant patients with suspected pre-eclampsia should be transported to an ERC with OB capability.

**Severe pre-eclampsia is manifested by:**
- Systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg
- Decreased urine output
- Persistent headache, visual disturbances
- Epigastric pain
- Pulmonary edema, or cyanosis

**Eclampsia is manifested by:**
- Generalized seizures or coma (in addition to symptoms/signs above)

**Pregnancy related hypertension and seizures can occur up to a month post-partum.**
