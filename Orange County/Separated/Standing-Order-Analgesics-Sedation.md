## Pain and Sedation Management Guidelines

### Pain Assessment
**Use 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale:**
- **0:** No pain
- **1-3:** Mild pain
- **4-6:** Moderate pain
- **7-9:** Severe pain
- **10:** Worst pain imaginable

**Alternative Methods:**
- FACES scale for patients with communication barriers
- Behavioral indicators (grimacing, guarding, vital sign changes)
- FLACC scale (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability)

### Choosing the Right Analgesic

#### Fentanyl Preferred For:
- Cardiac pain (minimal hemodynamic effects)
- Patients needing rapid pain relief
- Intranasal route when IV not available
- Hemodynamically unstable patients
- Renal failure patients
- Elderly patients

#### Morphine Preferred For:
- Moderate to severe pain
- Pulmonary edema (reduces preload)
- Longer duration of action needed
- When cost is a factor

### Opioid Safety Guidelines

#### Before Administration:
- Assess pain level (0-10)
- Obtain baseline vital signs
- Ensure oxygen available
- Have Naloxone immediately available
- Check for allergies
- Document last dose of pain medication

#### During Transport:
- Continuous monitoring
- Reassess pain every 10 minutes
- Watch for respiratory depression
- Monitor level of consciousness
- Be prepared to support ventilation

#### Signs of Opioid Overdose:
- Respiratory rate < 10/min
- Decreased level of consciousness
- Pinpoint pupils
- Cyanosis
- Apnea

### Sedation Levels

#### Minimal Sedation (Anxiolysis):
- Responds normally to verbal stimulation
- Cognitive function may be impaired
- Airway reflexes intact

#### Moderate Sedation:
- Responds to verbal or light tactile stimulation
- Airway reflexes intact
- Adequate spontaneous ventilation

#### Deep Sedation:
- Not easily aroused
- May require repeated or painful stimulation
- May require airway support

#### General Anesthesia:
- Unarousable
- Requires airway management
- Often impaired cardiovascular function

### Seizure Management with Midazolam

#### Active Seizure Protocol:
1. Ensure scene safety
2. Protect patient from injury
3. Position on side if possible
4. Suction as needed
5. Administer oxygen
6. Obtain IV/IO access if possible
7. Administer Midazolam (IM preferred if no IV)
8. Monitor respiratory status
9. Be prepared to assist ventilation
10. Transport with continuous monitoring

#### Status Epilepticus:
- Seizure lasting > 5 minutes
- Recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness
- Medical emergency requiring aggressive treatment
- Administer Midazolam as per protocol
- Contact Base Hospital if seizures continue
- Prepare for airway management

### Behavioral Emergency Guidelines

#### Chemical Restraint Indications:
- Danger to self or others
- Medical assessment/treatment impossible due to agitation
- Suspected excited delirium syndrome
- Severe agitation from stimulant intoxication

#### Safety First:
- Ensure adequate personnel (law enforcement if needed)
- Consider physical restraints if chemical restraint refused
- Never turn back on agitated patient
- Have escape route planned
- Protect yourself and crew

#### Post-Sedation Care:
- Continuous monitoring mandatory
- Position on side if possible
- Suction available
- Oxygen applied
- Frequent vital signs
- Document level of consciousness
- Be prepared for respiratory depression

## Combination Therapy Considerations

### Opioid + Benzodiazepine
- **Risk:** Synergistic respiratory depression
- **Monitoring:** Continuous pulse oximetry, capnography if available
- **Precaution:** Reduce doses of both agents
- **Reversal:** Have both Naloxone and Flumazenil available

### Multiple Opioid Doses
- **Maximum:** Generally 2 doses per protocol
- **Reassessment:** Evaluate response before additional dosing
- **Alternative:** Consider non-pharmacologic interventions
- **Contact BH:** If inadequate pain control after protocol doses

---

## Special Populations

### Elderly Patients
- Start with lower doses (reduce by 25-50%)
- Slower metabolism and clearance
- Higher risk of adverse effects
- More sensitive to respiratory depression
- May have cognitive impairment

### Chronic Pain Patients
- May be opioid-tolerant
- May require higher doses
- Document baseline medication use
- Avoid judgmental attitudes
- Focus on objective findings

### Substance Use Disorder
- Still deserves adequate pain management
- May require higher opioid doses if tolerant
- May have altered pain perception
- Document objectively
- Treat pain, not addiction

### Pregnant Patients
- **Fentanyl:** Category C (use if benefits outweigh risks)
- **Morphine:** Category C (use if benefits outweigh risks)
- **Midazolam:** Category D (avoid unless necessary)
- Consider effect on fetus
- Document clearly
