## INDICATIONS:

Transcutaneous Pacing (TCP) is for temporary management of symptomatic bradycardia, including heart blocks (adults/adolescents and children with a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute).

**Symptomatic includes poor perfusion related to the bradycardia as demonstrated by:**

• Hypotension (adult systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or children with systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg).

• Shortness of breath.

• Acute altered level of consciousness.

• Chest pain of suspected cardiac origin.

• Skin signs suggestive of poor perfusion.

Atropine 1 mg IV/IO/IM every 3-5 minutes as needed should be tried first. If unable to attain IV/IO access or 1 mg Atropine fails to improve heart rate, TCP should be utilized while continuing atropine dosing to a maximum of 3 mg.

## CONTRAINDICATIONS:

1. Asystole or PEA cardiac arrest.

---

## PROCEDURE:

- All TCP equipment must be used and maintained as described in manufacturer's guidelines.

- Explain TCP procedure to patient, family member, or care giver.

- Place appropriate size pacing pads in anterior-posterior chest and back position.

- Attach pacing cables to pads.

- Activate the pacing module and set initial pacing rate at 70 bpm and current to 0 (zero) milliamperes (mA).

- Slowly increase the mA (current) delivered until electrical and mechanical capture is achieved as demonstrated by palpable pulses that correspond to electrical pacing spikes (maximum 120 mA).

- Once electrical and mechanic capture is achieved, slowly increase heart rate, if necessary, to relieve patient symptoms related to bradycardia (maximum rate of 100 bpm).

- Consider sedation if patient cannot tolerate discomfort after initiating pacing and systolic BP greater than 90:

  **Adult/Adolescent (may give as standing order):**
  - Midazolam 5 mg IV once; OR
  - Midazolam 5 mg IN; if needed, may repeat once after approximately 3 minutes

  **If a child (13 months to less than 15 years) requires additional sedation during transport, contact Base Hospital (if 911 transport) for further orders.**

- If electrical or mechanical capture does not occur, manage the patient with atropine or epinephrine per appropriate standing order SO-C-20 or SO-P-45.
