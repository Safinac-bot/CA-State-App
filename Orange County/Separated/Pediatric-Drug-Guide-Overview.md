## Purpose

This guide provides weight-based medication dosing for pediatric patients treated by Orange County prehospital ALS providers. All doses are calculated based on patient weight with volumes (mLs) pre-calculated for field use.

---

## How to Use This Guide

### 1. Determine Patient Weight
- **Use Broselow Tape** (preferred method for patients who fit)
- **Estimate by age** if Broselow not available
- **Ask parent/caregiver** for recent weight
- **Use clinical judgment** for best weight estimate

### 2. Select Appropriate Weight Category File
Choose the file that matches the patient's weight:

| Weight Category | Age Approximation | File Name |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 3-5 kg | Newborn | Newborn (3-5 kg) |
| 6-7 kg | 3 months | 3-Months (6-7 kg) |
| 8-9 kg | 6 months | 6-Months (8-9 kg) |
| 10-11 kg | 1 year | 1-Year (10-11 kg) |
| 12-14 kg | 2 years | 2-Years (12-14 kg) |
| 15-18 kg | 3-4 years | 3-4-Years (15-18 kg) |
| 19-23 kg | 5-6 years | 5-6-Years (19-23 kg) |
| 24-29 kg | 7-8 years | 7-8-Years (24-29 kg) |
| 30-36 kg | 9-12 years | 9-12-Years (30-36 kg) |
| 37-49 kg | 13-14 years | 13-14-Years (37-49 kg) |

### 3. Find the Medication and Route
- Each file contains all medications for that weight
- Doses are listed with exact mL volumes
- Routes are specified (IV, IO, IM, IN, Neb, etc.)

### 4. Note Base Hospital Orders (BHO)
- **Medications marked with **** require Base Hospital Order**
- Contact Base Hospital before administration
- Standing orders do NOT require Base Hospital contact

---

## Important Notes

### All Milliliters Rounded
- Volumes have been pre-calculated and rounded for practical field use
- Follow the mL volumes exactly as listed

### Medication Concentrations
- Each medication listing includes its concentration
- Verify concentration matches what you're carrying
- Do NOT calculate different concentrations in the field

### Age Restrictions
- Some medications marked "**BHO <2 yrs**" require Base Hospital Order for patients under 2 years old
- Follow age-specific restrictions carefully

### Dilution Requirements
- Sodium Bicarbonate: Use 1:1 dilution with Normal Saline for pediatric patients
- Follow specific dilution instructions when noted

---

## Normal Vital Signs by Age

| Age | Heart Rate | Respirations | SBP |
|-----|------------|--------------|-----|
| Newborn | 100-180 | 30-60 | >60 mmHg |
| 3 months | 100-160 | 25-40 | >70 mmHg |
| 6 months | 100-160 | 20-40 | >70 mmHg |
| 1 year | 90-140 | 24-40 | >80 mmHg |
| 2 years | 90-140 | 20-30 | >80 mmHg |
| 3-4 years | 80-130 | 20-30 | >85 mmHg |
| 5-6 years | 70-120 | 15-30 | >85 mmHg |
| 7-8 years | 70-110 | 15-30 | >90 mmHg |
| 9-12 years | 60-100 | 15-20 | >90 mmHg |
| 13-14 years | 60-100 | 15-20 | >90 mmHg |

---

## Defibrillation and Cardioversion

### Defibrillation Doses (Cardiac Arrest)
- **Dose Range:** 2-4 J/kg
- Use specific joule values listed in each weight category file
- Biphasic preferred

### Cardioversion Doses (Synchronized)
- **Dose:** 1 J/kg
- Requires Base Hospital Order (**)
- Conscious sedation required (Midazolam)

---

## Special Considerations

### Medications Requiring Base Hospital Order
The following medications are marked with ** and require Base Hospital contact:
- Adenosine (both doses)
- Amiodarone (VT with pulse)
- Epinephrine (Push dose)
- Fentanyl (all routes)
- Hydroxocobalamin
- Midazolam (Toxic delirium and Cardioversion)
- Morphine (all routes)
- Cardioversion procedure

### Age-Specific Restrictions
- **Morphine and Fentanyl:** Require Base Hospital Order for patients <2 years old
- Document age and reason for administration
- Have reversal agent (Naloxone) immediately available

### Intranasal Naloxone
- Single spray 4 mg/0.1 mL available for all weight categories
- Useful when IV/IO access difficult
- May need to repeat based on response

### Sodium Bicarbonate Dilution
- **MUST dilute 1:1 with Normal Saline** for pediatric use
- Prevents hypertonicity complications
- Mix before administration

---

## Safety Reminders

### Critical Medication Alerts

**Epinephrine Concentration:**
- **1:1,000 (1 mg/1 mL)** = IM route for anaphylaxis
- **1:10,000 (0.1 mg/1 mL)** = IV/IO route for cardiac arrest
- **10 mcg/mL** = Push dose (Base Hospital Order)
- ALWAYS verify concentration before administration

**Atropine Concentration:**
- Two different concentrations listed (1 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL)
- Verify which concentration you're using
- mL volume changes significantly with concentration

**Naloxone Concentration:**
- Multiple concentrations available
- 0.8 mg/2 mL, 1 mg/mL, 4 mg/0.1 mL (intranasal spray)
- Check concentration to give correct volume

### Dose Verification
- **Double-check:**
  1. Patient weight
  2. Medication name
  3. Concentration
  4. mL volume
  5. Route of administration
- Have partner verify calculations when possible

### Documentation
- Document weight used for calculations
- Record actual dose given (mg or mcg)
- Note volume administered (mL)
- Record patient response
- Document any Base Hospital Orders received
