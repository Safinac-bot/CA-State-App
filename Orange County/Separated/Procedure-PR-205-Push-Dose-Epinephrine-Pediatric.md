1. Initiate fluid resuscitation with 20 mL/kg IV or IO bolus up to maximum dose of 250 mL. If no response and it appears that PDE would be indicated, make base hospital contact for PDE order.

2. If patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema, do not administer fluids but go directly to base hospital contact.

3. Paramedics may prepare PDE dose prior to base hospital contact but cannot administer medication without base hospital contact and order.
