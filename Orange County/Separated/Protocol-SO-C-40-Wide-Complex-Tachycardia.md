## Clinical Condition Overview

**Wide Complex Tachycardia** is characterized by:
- **Wide QRS complex** (≥ 0.12 seconds / 3 small boxes)
- **Heart rate > 100 bpm** (typically > 150 bpm)
- **Pulse present** (if no pulse, refer to SO-C-10 Cardiac Arrest)

**Most Likely Diagnosis:**
- **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)** - ASSUME THIS until proven otherwise
- Less commonly: SVT with aberrant conduction or pre-existing bundle branch block

**⚠️ CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:**
**When in doubt, treat as Ventricular Tachycardia** - safer to treat VT medications for SVT than SVT medications (like adenosine) for VT.

---

## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Cardiac Monitoring and Rhythm Documentation

**Monitor cardiac rhythm and document with rhythm strip or 12-lead ECG.**

**Key Assessment:**
- QRS width (≥ 0.12 seconds = wide)
- Heart rate
- Regular vs irregular
- Presence of P waves
- Patient symptoms
- Hemodynamic status

#### AICD (Automatic Implanted Cardiac Defibrillator) Considerations

**→ If AICD is in place and discharges ≥ 2 firings within 15 minutes, make Base Hospital contact for possible CVRC destination.**

**Why:**
- Repeated AICD firings indicate persistent or recurrent VT
- May indicate worsening cardiac condition
- May need electrophysiology evaluation
- CVRC has cardiology specialists available

**Ask Patient:**
- Do you have an AICD/ICD?
- Has it shocked you today?
- How many times?
- Is this normal for you?

---

### 2. Oxygen Therapy

**Pulse oximetry**; if room air O₂ Saturation less than 95%:

**► High-flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow as tolerated.**

---

### 3. Assess Hemodynamic Stability

**CRITICAL DECISION POINT:** Determine if patient is STABLE or UNSTABLE

---

## STABLE WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA

### Definition of Stable:
- **Systolic BP > 90 mm Hg**
- **Appropriate mental status** (alert and oriented)
- **Minimal chest discomfort**
- **Minimal shortness of breath**
- **Good perfusion** (normal skin signs)

### Treatment for STABLE Patients:

**o Monitor vital signs.**

**o ALS escort to nearest ERC.**

**Key Points:**
- NO cardioversion for stable patients
- NO medications (amiodarone/lidocaine) in field
- May deteriorate en route - reassess continuously
- Prepare for cardioversion if becomes unstable
- Brief transport time favors supportive care

---

## UNSTABLE WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA

### Definition of Unstable (ANY of the following):
- **Systolic BP ≤ 90 mm Hg**
- **Altered level of consciousness**
- **Chest pain** (more than minimal)
- **Signs of poor perfusion** (cool, clammy, pale)
- **Acute heart failure** (pulmonary edema)
- **Severe shortness of breath**

### Treatment Sequence for UNSTABLE Patients:

#### Step 1: First Cardioversion Attempt

**►Cardioversion: Synchronized 100 J Biphasic or manufacturer's recommended cardioversion setting**

**(Do not delay for IV access if deteriorating)**

**Procedure:**
1. Explain procedure to patient (if conscious)
2. Apply oxygen
3. Ensure monitor is in SYNC mode
4. Select 100 J (biphasic) or manufacturer's recommended setting
5. Ensure all clear
6. Deliver shock
7. Reassess rhythm immediately

**If Patient Conscious:**
- Consider sedation if time allows (midazolam)
- May need to proceed without sedation if critically unstable
- Explain what you're doing

---

#### Step 2: If Cardioversion Unsuccessful

**Establish IV/IO access if not already done**

**Amiodarone 150 mg slow IV/IO OR Lidocaine 1 mg/kg IV/IO**

**Choose ONE:**
- Prefer **Amiodarone** (more effective for VT)
- Use **Lidocaine** if amiodarone not available or contraindicated

**Administration:**
- Give SLOWLY over 2-3 minutes
- Monitor blood pressure (amiodarone can cause hypotension)
- Continue monitoring rhythm

---

#### Step 3: If VT Persists After 2-3 Minutes of Infusion

**→ If unstable Wide Complex tachycardia persists after 2-3 minutes of infusion:**

**► Cardioversion: At synchronized full voltage or manufacturer's recommended cardioversion setting.**

**Energy Level:**
- Maximum output (typically 200 J biphasic)
- Or manufacturer's recommended maximum

---

#### Step 4: If VT Still Persists

**→ If Wide Complex Tachycardia persists:**

**►Repeat Amiodarone 150 mg slow IV/IO OR Lidocaine 0.5 mg/kg IV/IO**

**Note:**
- Second dose of lidocaine is 0.5 mg/kg (half the initial dose)
- Second dose of amiodarone is same 150 mg
- Give slowly over 2-3 minutes

---

#### Step 5: Final Cardioversion Attempt

**→ After 2-3 minutes of infusing second dose of Amiodarone/lidocaine, if Wide Complex Tachycardia persists:**

**Cardioversion: At synchronized full voltage or manufacturer's recommended cardioversion setting.**

---

#### Step 6: Transport

**→ ALS escort to nearest ERC or contact Base Hospital as needed.**

**Base Hospital Contact for:**
- Refractory VT
- Multiple shocks required
- Patient deteriorating
- AICD with multiple firings
- Questions about additional treatment

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### Clinical Presentation

**Patients with stable wide complex tachycardia may present as:**
- Syncope or near-syncope
- Weakness, fatigue
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Shortness of breath
- Light-headedness, dizziness
- Palpitations

**Any patient with these symptoms should have cardiac monitoring with rhythm strip documented.**

---

### Stable vs. Unstable: Key Principle

**Stable wide complex tachycardia** (blood pressure present with minimal chest discomfort, alert and oriented, and minimal shortness of breath) **is best transported without cardioversion or pharmacologic treatment.**

**Why?**
- Short transport times in most cases
- Hospital can provide controlled environment
- Can perform detailed evaluation
- Can use additional resources if needed
- Avoids risks of field cardioversion/medications

**However:** Monitor continuously - can deteriorate rapidly

---

### Medication Considerations

#### Amiodarone

**Amiodarone is associated with hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation and should be administered slowly to avoid profound drops in blood pressure.**

**Dose:**
- **First dose:** 150 mg IV/IO over 2-3 minutes
- **Second dose:** 150 mg IV/IO over 2-3 minutes (if needed)

**Mechanism:**
- Blocks multiple ion channels
- Prolongs action potential duration
- Slows conduction
- Effective for VT

**Administration:**
- MUST give slowly (2-3 minutes minimum)
- Watch blood pressure closely
- Can cause hypotension (vasodilation)
- Monitor for bradycardia after conversion

**Side Effects:**
- Hypotension (MOST COMMON)
- Bradycardia after conversion
- Rarely: torsades de pointes

---

#### Lidocaine

**Alternative to amiodarone**

**Dose:**
- **First dose:** 1 mg/kg IV/IO (typical 70-100 mg for average adult)
- **Second dose:** 0.5 mg/kg IV/IO (if needed)

**Mechanism:**
- Sodium channel blocker
- Decreases automaticity in ventricles
- Suppresses ventricular ectopy
- Traditional VT medication

**Administration:**
- Give slowly over 2-3 minutes
- Calculate dose based on estimated weight
- Watch for CNS effects

**Side Effects:**
- CNS toxicity (confusion, seizures at high doses)
- Hypotension (less common than amiodarone)
- Perioral numbness, metallic taste
- Tinnitus

---

### Synchronized Cardioversion Procedure

#### Energy Levels:
- **Initial:** 100 J biphasic (or manufacturer's recommendation)
- **Subsequent:** Full voltage / maximum output (typically 200 J biphasic)

#### CRITICAL: SYNC MODE

**MUST use SYNCHRONIZED cardioversion:**
- Delivers shock on R wave
- Avoids T wave (prevents R-on-T phenomenon)
- R-on-T can cause VF

**How to Ensure SYNC:**
1. Press SYNC button on defibrillator
2. Look for "SYNC" indicator on screen
3. Confirm markers appear on R waves
4. After each shock, reactivate SYNC (resets to unsync)

#### Steps for Cardioversion:
1. Ensure patient has pulse (if no pulse → defibrillate, not cardiovert)
2. Apply oxygen
3. Establish IV/IO if time allows (don't delay if unstable)
4. Consider sedation if conscious and stable enough
5. Activate SYNC mode
6. Select appropriate energy
7. Charge defibrillator
8. Clear everyone (ensure all clear)
9. Deliver shock while pressing both buttons
10. Reassess rhythm immediately
11. Reactivate SYNC if another shock needed

#### Sedation for Cardioversion:
- **If conscious and time allows:** Midazolam 2-5 mg IV slowly
- **If critically unstable:** Proceed without sedation
- Explain procedure to patient
- Document sedation given

## Distinguishing VT from SVT with Aberrancy

### Why This Matters:
- Treatment differs
- VT is immediately life-threatening
- SVT with aberrancy often stable

### **DEFAULT ASSUMPTION: Treat as VT**

**When in doubt, assume Ventricular Tachycardia**
- Safer to give VT medications to patient with SVT
- Dangerous to give SVT medications (adenosine) to VT patient
- Most wide complex tachycardias are VT

---

### Clues Suggesting Ventricular Tachycardia:

**Favor VT if:**
- History of heart disease, prior MI
- Age > 35 years
- AV dissociation (P waves march through independently)
- Very wide QRS (> 0.14 seconds)
- Extreme axis deviation
- Concordance (all QRS in same direction in precordial leads)
- Specific morphology patterns (Brugada criteria)
- Regular rhythm
- Rate 150-250 bpm

**Bottom Line:** If wide and fast, treat as VT in field

---

### SVT with Aberrancy (Less Common):

**Characteristics:**
- History of SVT
- Younger patient, no heart disease
- Known bundle branch block
- Very rapid rate (> 220 bpm - less likely VT)
- Irregular rhythm (AFib with BBB)

**Prehospital Approach:**
- Still treat as VT for unstable patient
- If stable, supportive care and transport
- Hospital can determine definitively

---

## Special Considerations

### AICD/ICD Patients

**Background:**
- Automatic Implanted Cardiac Defibrillator
- Detects VT/VF and delivers shock
- Patients with history of VT or high risk

**If AICD Fires:**
- Patient may feel shock ("kick in chest")
- Usually effective at converting
- Multiple shocks = problem

**≥ 2 Firings in 15 Minutes:**
- Indicates persistent or recurrent VT
- Base Hospital contact REQUIRED
- Consider CVRC destination
- May need electrophysiology evaluation
- Possible AICD malfunction
- May need medication adjustment

**Prehospital Care:**
- Follow protocol as usual
- Can cardiovert even with AICD (won't harm device)
- Apply pads away from device if possible
- Document AICD activity
- Transport to appropriate facility

---

### Torsades de Pointes

**Special Type of Polymorphic VT:**
- "Twisting of the points"
- QRS changes amplitude and axis
- Associated with prolonged QT interval
- Different treatment (magnesium, pacing)

**If Suspected:**
- Contact Base Hospital
- May order magnesium sulfate 2 g IV
- May order defibrillation instead of cardioversion
- Often unstable

**Causes of Torsades:**
- Medications (many cardiac and psych drugs)
- Electrolyte abnormalities (low K⁺, Mg²⁺)
- Congenital long QT syndrome

---

### Pulseless VT

**If pulse is lost:**
- **STOP** this protocol
- Switch to **SO-C-10 Cardiac Arrest protocol**
- Immediate **defibrillation** (NOT synchronized)
- Begin CPR
- Follow ACLS algorithm

---

### Stable VT

**Why Transport Without Treatment:**
- Most stable VT can wait for hospital
- Controlled environment for cardioversion
- Access to more resources
- Lower risk than field treatment
- Short transport times

**What to Monitor:**
- Can deteriorate suddenly
- Watch for hypotension
- Watch for chest pain worsening
- Watch for altered mental status
- Be prepared to cardiovert

---

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Wide + Fast with Pulse = Assume VT** until proven otherwise  
✓ **Stable = No treatment** in field, monitor and transport  
✓ **Unstable = Cardiovert** starting at 100 J synchronized  
✓ **SYNC mode essential** - check for markers on R waves  
✓ **Amiodarone preferred** (150 mg slow over 2-3 min)  
✓ **Lidocaine alternative** (1 mg/kg, then 0.5 mg/kg)  
✓ **Give slowly** - both drugs can cause hypotension  
✓ **AICD ≥ 2 firings** = Base contact required  
✓ **If pulse lost** → switch to cardiac arrest protocol  
✓ **Reactivate SYNC** after each cardioversion

## Common Errors to Avoid

❌ **Using adenosine for wide complex tachycardia** (dangerous if VT)  
❌ **Forgetting SYNC mode** (will cause VF if defibrillate on T wave)  
❌ **Cardioverting stable patients** (not indicated)  
❌ **Giving amiodarone/lidocaine too fast** (causes hypotension)  
❌ **Not documenting AICD firings** (important for destination)  
❌ **Forgetting to reactivate SYNC** after cardioversion  
❌ **Delaying cardioversion for IV** in critically unstable patient  
❌ **Treating as SVT without strong evidence**  

---

**This protocol requires careful assessment of stability, appropriate use of synchronized cardioversion, and judicious medication administration. When in doubt about rhythm diagnosis, treat as ventricular tachycardia for patient safety.**
