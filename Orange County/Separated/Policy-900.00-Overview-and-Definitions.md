## III. DEFINITIONS

### Multi-Casualty Incident (MCI)
An incident with sufficient casualties or medical victims such that field scene command (Incident Command System) is established. The event is declared by the scene incident commander or as needed for hospital-based management by an Orange County Base Hospital.

### MCI Activation Alert
Announcement initiated by a Base Hospital (BH) or Orange County Communications (OCC) and sent over ReddiNet to activate hospitals, advising them of the incident type and that each hospital must update their ReddiNet Patient Care Capacity Inventory (PCCI).

### MCI Informational Message
A countywide broadcast(s) to all ReddiNet/H.E.A.R. hospitals with preliminary and follow-up information regarding a Multi-Casualty Incident.

### MCI Patient Report
A limited report delivered when Base Hospital contact is made from the scene of an MCI with a request for receiving hospital destinations. MCI patient report elements will differ based on the type of incident, safety at the scene, and number of victims (see Appendix A â€“ Level of MCI and Patient Report).

### Medical Communications Coordinator (Med Com)
Individual at the scene of an MCI that communicates with the BH or other coordinating facility/agency to maintain status of available hospital capacity and provides transporting units with destination assignments.

### Patient Care Capacity Inventory (PCCI)
The number of MCI patients for whom a hospital can provide care without prior notification.

### START
An acronym for Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment, an assessment of respirations, pulse (perfusion), and mental status resulting in a classification of "immediate", "delayed", "minor" or "expectant". At the MCI scene, START is used to determine which victims require an ALS level assessment.

#### Patient Status Classifications of S.T.A.R.T.:

**Immediate (red):** Highest level of patient priority. A patient that requires rapid assessment and medical intervention to increase chance of survival.

**Delayed (yellow):** Second level of patient priority. Injuries or exposure are less severe or pose no immediate threat to life.

**Minor (green):** Third level of patient priority. A victim that requires only simple medical care.

**Expectant (black):** Lowest patient priority, found pulseless and non-breathing.

### Split Paramedic Teams
When a two-paramedic team is separated to treat or transport separate victims, and divide their ALS equipment and supplies in a manner that is reasonable for the circumstances.

### Triage Tag
A unique numbered identification and information card attached to each patient in an MCI. The START Triage category assigned the patient is indicated at the bottom of the card.
