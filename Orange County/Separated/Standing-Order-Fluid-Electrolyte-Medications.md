## Normal Saline

### Medication Information
**Generic Name:** 0.9% Sodium Chloride  
**Class:** Isotonic Crystalloid Solution

### Form
Crystalloid in IV bag

### Route
IV/IO

### Formulations and Standing Orders

#### Formulation 1: Hypotension/Shock
**Indication(s):**
1. Hypotension or signs of poor perfusion suspected to be due to hemorrhage, hypovolemia, sepsis, dehydration, or anaphylaxis

**Standing Order:** 250 mL bolus IV, may repeat to total of 1 liter to maintain perfusion

#### Formulation 2: Traumatic Shock/Full Arrest
**Indication(s):**
1. Traumatic shock or
2. Hypotension; Trauma full arrest; Hypotension (hypovolemia) with vaginal hemorrhage
3. Crush injury of major muscle group greater than 1 hour

**Standing Order:** 250 mL Normal Saline fluid bolus IV and recheck signs of perfusion; continue Normal Saline as a wide-open infusion to attain or maintain perfusion.

#### Formulation 3: Stimulant Intoxication/Agitated Delirium
**Indication:** Stimulant intoxication; Agitated (Excited) delirium  
**Standing Order:** 250 mL bolus IV, may repeat to total of 1 liter to maintain perfusion if IV access can be safely established.

#### Formulation 4: Narrow QRS Complex Tachycardia
**Indication(s):**
1. Narrow QRS complex, regular tachycardia with rate 100-150 and lungs clear to auscultation or greater than 150 with suspected dehydration and lungs clear to auscultation
2. Cardiac Arrest with PEA or asystole

**Standing Order:** 250 mL bolus IV, may repeat to total of 1 liter to maintain perfusion (hold if signs of congestive heart failure)

### Clinical Pearls
- Isotonic crystalloid (308 mOsm/L)
- Same osmolality as plasma
- Expands intravascular volume
- Only 25-30% remains intravascular after 1 hour
- Safe for most conditions
- Can cause fluid overload
- Large volumes can cause hyperchloremic acidosis
- Room temperature fluids can cause hypothermia
- Warmed fluids preferred in trauma/hypothermia

### Indications for Fluid Bolus

#### Hypovolemic Shock:
- Hemorrhage (trauma, GI bleed)
- Dehydration (vomiting, diarrhea, poor intake)
- Third-spacing (burns, sepsis, pancreatitis)

#### Distributive Shock:
- Sepsis
- Anaphylaxis
- Neurogenic shock

#### Special Circumstances:
- Crush injury (rhabdomyolysis prevention)
- Hyperkalemia (dilution)
- Medication administration
- IV access maintenance

### Contraindications (Relative)
- Pulmonary edema
- Congestive heart failure
- Fluid overload
- Hypernatremia

### Precautions
- Monitor for fluid overload
- Lung sounds before and after
- May worsen CHF
- Can cause peripheral edema
- Large volumes can cause electrolyte imbalance
- Hypothermia with large volume cold fluids
- Hyperchloremic acidosis with massive volumes

### Signs of Fluid Overload
- Increased work of breathing
- Crackles/rales on lung auscultation
- Increased jugular venous distention
- Peripheral edema
- Hypoxia
- Frothy sputum
- Worsening vital signs

### Fluid Resuscitation Principles

#### Initial Assessment:
- **Perfusion:** Skin color, temperature, moisture
- **Mental Status:** Alert vs altered
- **Vital Signs:** HR, BP, RR
- **Capillary Refill:** < 2 seconds normal
- **Urine Output:** If known

#### Bolus Strategy:
- **Adults:** 250-500 mL boluses
- **Reassess** after each bolus
- **Titrate** to signs of perfusion
- **Monitor** for fluid overload
- **Document** total volume

#### Endpoints of Resuscitation:
- Improved mental status
- Improved skin perfusion
- Heart rate < 100 (if not other cause)
- Systolic BP > 90 mmHg
- Improved urine output
- Decreased capillary refill time

#### Special Situations

**Hemorrhagic Shock:**
- Permissive hypotension (SBP 80-90 if no head injury)
- SBP > 90 if head injury suspected
- Avoid excessive fluids (dilutes clotting factors, worsens hypothermia)
- Rapid transport to definitive care
- Consider tranexamic acid if available

**Cardiogenic Shock:**
- Minimal or no fluids
- May worsen pulmonary edema
- Consider vasopressors (Base Hospital contact)
- Focus on underlying cause

**Septic Shock:**
- Aggressive fluid resuscitation
- 30 mL/kg may be needed
- Monitor for fluid overload
- Early antibiotics critical
- Source control important

**Neurogenic Shock:**
- Fluids first line
- May need vasopressors
- Maintain adequate perfusion
- Spinal cord injury precautions

### Monitoring Requirements
- Vital signs before and after each bolus
- Lung sounds before and after
- Level of consciousness
- Skin perfusion
- Capillary refill
- Jugular venous distention
- Total fluid administered
- Peripheral edema

## Sodium Bicarbonate

### Medication Information
**Generic Name:** Sodium Bicarbonate  
**Class:** Alkalinizing Agent, Electrolyte

### Form
8.4% Solution

### Route
IV/IO appropriate if patient unconscious and IV cannot be established

### Indication
Crush injury of major muscle group greater than 1 hour

### Standing Order
50 mL prefilled syringe IV/(IO) once

### Clinical Pearls
- Alkalinizes blood and urine
- Buffers metabolic acidosis
- Promotes potassium shift into cells
- Important in crush injury (prevents renal damage from myoglobin)
- Increases urine pH (helps clear myoglobin)
- Can cause fluid overload (high sodium content)
- Hyperosmolar solution (2000 mOsm/L)
- Incompatible with many drugs (flush line before and after)

### Mechanism in Crush Injury

#### Rhabdomyolysis Prevention:
1. Muscle breakdown releases myoglobin and potassium
2. Myoglobin precipitates in renal tubules (especially if acidic urine)
3. Alkalinizing urine prevents precipitation
4. Reduces acute kidney injury risk
5. Helps manage hyperkalemia

### Contraindications
- Metabolic or respiratory alkalosis
- Hypocalcemia (may worsen)
- Known hypersensitivity

### Precautions
- Can cause metabolic alkalosis
- May worsen CHF (sodium and fluid load)
- Can cause hypokalemia (shifts K+ into cells)
- May paradoxically worsen intracellular acidosis
- Extravasation causes tissue damage
- Incompatible with calcium (precipitates)
- Incompatible with catecholamines

### Side Effects
- **Common:** Metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, fluid overload
- **Serious:** Tissue necrosis if extravasates, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, tetany
- **Rare:** Cerebral hemorrhage from rapid pH change, seizures

### Monitoring Requirements
- IV site patency (ensure good access)
- Vital signs
- Level of consciousness
- Signs of fluid overload
- Extremity assessment in crush injury
- Urine output and color if possible
- Cardiac rhythm (hyperkalemia signs)

- Skin changes (blisters, mottling)

### Treatment Protocol

1. **Scene safety** - ensure no ongoing threat

2. **High-flow oxygen** - maintain SpOâ‚‚ > 94%

3. **IV access** - large bore (18g or larger), two sites if possible

4. **Normal Saline** - wide open initial bolus
   - Goal: 1-1.5 L/hour
   - Continue throughout transport
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation critical

5. **Sodium Bicarbonate** - 50 mL IV once
   - Alkalinize urine
