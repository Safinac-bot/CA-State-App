## INDICATION:

Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA, Alteplase) is a thrombolytic (clot dissolving) agent used in early stage treatment of acute ischemic stroke. TPA dissolves blood clots that may be occluding cerebral arteries and causing an acute ischemic stroke. TPA is used for the management of acute ischemic (not hemorrhagic) stroke. The primary risk for use of TPA is development of life threatening hemorrhage.

## PROCEDURE:

1. Obtain transfer records from transferring facility representative, assure receiving facility is properly identified.

2. Transfer cardiac monitor to portable transport monitor and assure proper operation.

3. Assure vascular access is stable and secure.

4. Take report for dosage, flow rate, and when current TPA infusion started from transferring facility RN.

5. Record drug, dosage, flow rate, and when current TPA infusion started on PCR. Document level of consciousness, heart rate and rhythm, and blood pressure at time of initiation of transfer.

6. Transfer infusion from hospital to transport infusion pump and assure proper operation of infusion system. Infusion rate is determined by transferring facility RN or physician.

7. TPA must be infused by pump during transport.

8. Assess blood pressure, heart rate/rhythm, and level of consciousness every five minutes during transport.

9. Immediately discontinue TPA infusion for the following:
   - A. Acute altered level of consciousness
   - B. Complaint of headache (not present previously)
   - C. Onset of uncontrolled vomiting
   - D. Systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg
   - E. Diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg
   - F. Seizure - focal or generalized

   Document findings and time infusion stopped. Proceed to receiving facility and report occurrence requiring discontinuation immediately upon arrival.

10. Document vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and patient condition when transferred to care of receiving facility.

---

## CAUTIONS:

1. A potential complication of TPA is uncontrolled hemorrhage; special care must be taken to avoid injury during loading and off-loading of patient.

2. If onset of bradycardia occurs during transport, immediately assess vital signs and mental status.

3. Treat cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory or cardiac arrest using general standing orders.
