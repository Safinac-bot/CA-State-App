## INDICATION:

Heparin is an anticoagulant often used for the emergency treatment of cardiac and stroke victims; it is also used for management of patients with blood clot formation in the lungs, veins, or arteries. As an anticoagulant, a risk of heparin is abnormal or uncontrolled bleeding.

## PROCEDURE:

- Assure vascular access is stable and secure.

- Assure infusion pump is in working order and available for use during transport.

- Monitor and document cardiac rhythm and vital signs.

- Question appropriate transferring facility personnel (RN or MD) prior to transport:
  - What is the prescribed heparin infusion rate?
  - Has the patient had any known bleeding?

- Obtain pertinent copies of the medical records.

- Set-up transfer infusion pump at the rate of infusion indicated as prescribed by the sending facility personnel (RN or MD).

- Initiate transport and maintain infusion rate prescribed by sending facility staff.

- Observe patient vital signs and monitored cardiac rhythm on a continuous basis.

- Observe patient for any signs of bleeding or hemorrhage, including external bleeding, bleeding from nose or mouth, vomiting blood, or passing blood rectally. If signs of bleeding occur, immediately stop infusion and transport to nearest appropriate ERC.

- Observe patient for decreases in blood pressure, if blood pressure decreases below 90 systolic, or more than 20 mm/Hg systolic from initial blood pressure determination, discontinue infusion and transport to the nearest appropriate ERC.

- Document vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and patient condition when transferred to care of receiving facility.
