## Terminology: "Non-Fatal Drowning"

**Current WHO Definition:**
- **Drowning** = process of respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid
- **Non-fatal drowning** = patient survives (previously called "near-drowning")
- **Fatal drowning** = death from drowning

**This protocol covers non-fatal drowning with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)**

---

## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Spinal Motion Restriction

**Spinal motion restriction if diving or shore-break accident.**

**Indications:**
- Diving accident
- Shore-break injury (wave slams person into bottom)
- Shallow water incident
- Unknown mechanism
- Neurologic deficits
- Neck/back pain
- Altered mental status preventing assessment

**High-Risk Mechanisms:**
- Diving into shallow water
- Surfing/bodysurfing with shore-break
- Water slide injury
- Watercraft collision
- Fall into water
- Alcohol involvement

**Assessment:**
- Level of consciousness
- Neurologic exam
- Mechanism of injury
- Patient complaints
- Witness information

---

### 2. Oxygen Therapy

**Pulse oximetry; if oxygen saturation less than 95%:**

**► Oxygen, high-flow by mask or nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow rate as tolerated.**

**Key Points:**
- Goal: SpO₂ ≥ 95%
- High-flow oxygen
- Non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min if significant hypoxia
- Nasal cannula if tolerating well
- Minimum 6 L/min flow rate

**Why Oxygen Needed:**
- Hypoxia from impaired gas exchange
- Pulmonary edema (water in alveoli)
- Surfactant washout
- V/Q mismatch
- May worsen over time

**Monitor:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Respiratory rate and effort
- Mental status
- Skin color

---

### 3. Cardiac Arrest Management

**Treat cardiac arrest same as SO-C-10 (Cardiac Cardiopulmonary Arrest).**

**If Patient in Cardiac Arrest:**
- Immediate CPR
- High-quality chest compressions
- Defibrillation if VF/pulseless VT
- ACLS medications
- Advanced airway
- Follow SO-C-10 protocol completely

**Special Considerations:**
- Hypothermia common (cold water)
- "Not dead until warm and dead"
- Continue resuscitation during rewarming
- May need prolonged CPR
- Better neurologic outcomes than other cardiac arrests
- Mammalian dive reflex protective (especially cold water, young patients)

**This protocol (SO-E-15) is for patients WITH pulse/breathing**

---

### 4. Cardiac Monitoring and Bradycardia Management

**Monitor cardiac rhythm and document with rhythm strip:**

**► For bradycardia, clear airway and assist ventilation with bag-valve-mask using high-flow oxygen.**

#### Bradycardia After Drowning:

**Common Cause:**
- Hypoxia
- Mammalian dive reflex
- Hypothermia

**First-Line Treatment:**
- **Clear the airway** (suction if needed)
- **Assist ventilation** with BVM
- **High-flow oxygen**
- Bradycardia often resolves with oxygenation/ventilation

**Do NOT use atropine as first-line:**
- Hypoxia-induced bradycardia won't respond to atropine
- Ventilation and oxygen are treatment
- If bradycardia persists despite adequate oxygenation, consider:
  - Hypothermia
  - Severe hypoxia/anoxic injury
  - Other causes

**Monitor:**
- Heart rate response to ventilation
- Rhythm on monitor
- Document rhythm strips

---

### 5. Bronchospasm Treatment

**For wheezing:**

**► Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated.**

**Why Wheezing Occurs:**
- Bronchospasm from water/contaminants in airways
- Pulmonary edema causing airway narrowing
- Aspiration of water (fresh or salt)
- Inflammatory response

**Administration:**
- Continuous nebulization
- 6 mL of 5 mg concentration
- Deliver with oxygen
- Continue throughout transport
- Patient must be breathing spontaneously

**Response:**
- Decreased wheezing
- Improved air movement
- Easier breathing
- May need repeated doses

---

### 6. CPAP for Respiratory Distress

**For conscious and continued respiratory distress after clearing airway (by suction or patient coughing):**

**►Apply CPAP as tolerated; guard against high risk for vomiting.**

#### CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure):

**Indications:**
- Conscious patient
- Continued respiratory distress
- After clearing airway
- Able to protect airway
- Cooperative
- Suspected pulmonary edema

**Benefits:**
- Recruits collapsed alveoli
- Improves oxygenation
- Reduces work of breathing
- Pushes fluid from alveoli back into circulation
- May prevent intubation

**Settings:**
- Typically 5-10 cm H₂O
- Start low, increase as tolerated
- High-flow oxygen (FiO₂ near 100%)

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:

**Guard against high risk for vomiting**

**Why High Vomiting Risk:**
- Water swallowed during drowning
- Gastric distention common
- CPAP increases gastric pressure
- May induce vomiting

**Precautions:**
- Monitor continuously
- Have suction ready immediately
- Be prepared to remove CPAP quickly
- Position patient to protect airway if vomits
- Consider NG/OG tube if severe distention

**Contraindications to CPAP:**
- Unconscious
- Cannot protect airway
- Vomiting
- Facial trauma
- Unable to tolerate mask
- Hypotension

---

### 7. Advanced Airway Management

**If unconscious or unable to protect airway:**

**► Advanced airway and confirm tube placement.**

**Indications:**
- Unconscious (GCS ≤8)
- Unable to protect airway
- Inadequate ventilation despite BVM
- Respiratory failure
- Persistent hypoxia
- Need for prolonged transport

**Options:**
- Endotracheal intubation (preferred if trained)
- Supraglottic airway (King, i-gel, LMA)
- Per local protocols

**Confirmation:**
- End-tidal CO₂ (waveform capnography)
- Bilateral breath sounds
- Chest rise
- Oxygen saturation improvement
- 5-point confirmation

**Post-Intubation:**
- Secure tube well
- Continue high-flow oxygen
- Ventilate appropriately (avoid hyperventilation)
- Monitor tube placement
- Suction as needed

**Special Considerations:**
- May have significant water/secretions in airway
- Suction thoroughly before intubation
- Cricoid pressure may help (if assistant available)
- May be difficult due to secretions, vomiting

---

### 8. Transport and Base Hospital Contact

**ALS escort to nearest appropriate ERC; contact Base Hospital for suspected spinal injury or trauma or as needed.**

**Transport:**
- ALS level care
- Continuous monitoring
- Nearest appropriate ERC

**Base Hospital Contact Required For:**
- **Suspected spinal injury**
- **Significant trauma**
- Questions about management
- Deteriorating patient
- Complex presentation

**Base Hospital Contact Considerations:**
- Destination determination
- Management questions
- Trauma center vs ERC
- Patient deteriorating despite treatment

**Monitor During Transport:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Cardiac monitoring
- Respiratory status
- Level of consciousness
- Temperature (if hypothermia suspected)
- Reassess frequently

## Understanding Drowning Pathophysiology

### What Happens During Drowning:

**Initial Submersion:**
1. Breath-holding (as long as possible)
2. Involuntary gasping/aspiration
3. Laryngospasm (protective reflex)
4. Small amount of water aspirated (typically 2-4 mL/kg)
5. Hypoxia develops
6. Laryngospasm relaxes
7. More water aspirated OR "dry drowning" (10-15%)
8. Severe hypoxia
9. Loss of consciousness
10. Cardiac arrest if not rescued

---

### Effects of Water Aspiration:

**Pulmonary Effects:**
- Surfactant washout
- Alveolar collapse
- Pulmonary edema
- V/Q mismatch (ventilation-perfusion)
- Decreased lung compliance
- Hypoxemia

**Both Fresh and Salt Water:**
- Cause similar effects
- Small amounts cause problems
- Old teaching about "wet" vs "dry" drowning less relevant
- All cause hypoxia

**Secondary Drowning:**
- Delayed pulmonary edema (hours later)
- Why all drowning patients need hospital evaluation
- Even if initially appear fine

---

### Hypothermia Considerations:

**Cold Water Immersion:**
- Rapid heat loss (water conducts heat 25× faster than air)
- Hypothermia common
- Protective for brain (decreased metabolic demand)
- Can tolerate longer hypoxia

**Mammalian Dive Reflex:**
- Bradycardia
- Peripheral vasoconstriction
- Shunting blood to vital organs
- Protective mechanism
- More prominent in:
  - Cold water
  - Young children
  - Facial immersion

**"Not Dead Until Warm and Dead":**
- Don't declare death if hypothermic
- Continue resuscitation while rewarming
- Remarkable survivals documented
- Especially in cold water
- Especially in children

---

## Clinical Assessment

### Scene Safety and Rescue:

**Safety First:**
- Ensure scene safe before entry
- Water rescue by trained personnel only
- Reach-throw-row-go (in that order)

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **All drowning patients need hospital evaluation** - even if seem fine  
✓ **Secondary drowning** can occur hours later  
✓ **Spinal precautions** for diving/shore-break mechanisms  
✓ **Oxygen first-line** for hypoxia  
✓ **Bradycardia:** treat with airway/ventilation/oxygen (not atropine)  
✓ **CPAP effective** but watch for vomiting  
✓ **Advanced airway** if cannot protect airway  
✓ **Hypothermia common** - "not dead until warm and dead"  
✓ **Base Hospital contact** for spinal injury or trauma  
✓ **Monitor continuously** - can deteriorate  

---

## Common Errors to Avoid

❌ **Discharging patient who seems fine** - secondary drowning risk  
❌ **Not considering spinal injury** with diving/shore-break  
❌ **Giving atropine for bradycardia** - ventilate instead  
❌ **CPAP without suction ready** - high vomiting risk  
❌ **Not documenting submersion time** - important prognostic factor  
❌ **Assuming warm = not hypothermic** - water causes rapid heat loss  
❌ **Stopping resuscitation too early** if cold water  
❌ **Not monitoring for deterioration** en route
