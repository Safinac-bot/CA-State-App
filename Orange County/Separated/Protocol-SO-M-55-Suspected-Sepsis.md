## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### Sepsis Screening Criteria:

**IF patient presents with known or suspected source of infection, such as:**

- Cough suggestive of pneumonia,
- Complaint of urinary tract infection/problems in the past or present
- Skin infection
- Known to be immune suppressed (refer to Treatment Guidelines below)

**AND**

**If any two of the following four symptoms are present:**

- → Altered mental status (GCS <13)
- → Systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg
- → Respiratory rate > 22 breaths/min
- → When temperature available, reported, or measured: temp > 100.4 F (38 C) or < 97 F (36 C).

**THEN**

**Treat suspected sepsis as follows:**

---

### 1. Cardiac Monitoring

**Cardiac monitor.**

- Continuous cardiac monitoring
- Document rhythm

---

### 2. Oxygen Therapy

**Pulse oximetry; if oxygen saturation less than 95%, provide:**

**► High flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 l/min flow rate as tolerated.**

- Goal: SpO₂ ≥ 95%
- High-flow oxygen

---

### 3. Vascular Access and Fluid Resuscitation

**Establish venous access:**

**► For BP < 100 systolic and lungs clear to auscultation (no evidence CHF), infuse 250 mL Normal Saline bolus. May repeat (if lungs remain clear to auscultation) up to maximum 1 liter to maintain adequate perfusion.**

**If BP < 90 after 1 liter of NS or if evidence of CHF develops before can complete 1 liter of NS infusion with BP remaining < 90, contact Base Hospital to request order for push dose epinephrine (PR-230).**

**Fluid Protocol:**
- **Indication:** BP < 100 systolic AND lungs clear
- **Dose:** Normal Saline 250 mL bolus
- **Reassess:** After each bolus, check lungs
- **Repeat:** May repeat if lungs remain clear
- **Maximum:** 1 liter total

**Base Hospital Contact:**
- If BP < 90 after 1 liter NS
- If CHF develops before completing 1 liter and BP remains < 90
- Request push dose epinephrine order (see PR-230)

---

### 4. Transport and Notification

**ALS escort to nearest ERC and with early notification of receiving facility that patient may be septic.**

- ALS level transport
- Nearest ERC
- **Early notification** - alert receiving facility of suspected sepsis
- Time-critical condition

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### 1. Suspected Sepsis Circumstances

**Frequent sites for sources of infection are pulmonary, urinary tract, and skin/soft tissue.**

**Common Infection Sources:**
- **Pulmonary:** Pneumonia, cough, dyspnea
- **Urinary Tract:** UTI, dysuria, frequency, suprapubic pain
- **Skin/Soft Tissue:** Cellulitis, abscess, wound infection

---

### Immunosuppressed Patients at Risk for Sepsis:

**Persons who have suppressed immune systems are at risk for sepsis, these may include persons:**

**i. Taking oral steroids (such as prednisone) for chronic diseases such as asthma and arthritis.**

**ii. Who have received organ transplants.**

**iii. With a history of cancer**

**iv. With history of diabetes**

**v. With history of renal failure**

---

### Other Considerations Increasing the Risk of Sepsis:

**i. Age > 50**

**ii. Acute or chronic altered mental status**

**iii. History of stroke**

**iv. Abdominal pain with fever**

**v. Resident of long-term healthcare facility**

**vi. Dispatched as Nonspecific Illness/Sick Person**

**vii. Nonspecific weak/dizzy presentation**

---

### 2. Fever Considerations

**The absence of fever does not rule out the possibility of infection or sepsis, particularly in the elderly or immunosuppressed patient.**

- Elderly may not mount fever response
- Immunosuppressed may be hypothermic
- Consider sepsis even without fever if other criteria met

---

### 3. Fluid Resuscitation Cautions

**Consider history of heart failure or renal disease to avoid fluid overload in the decision to administer an IV fluid bolus.**

**Cautions:**
- History of CHF
- Renal disease/dialysis patients
- Check lung sounds before and after each bolus
- Stop if rales develop
- Base Hospital if BP remains low after 1 liter or CHF develops

---

## Sepsis Recognition - Quick Reference

### Criteria (Must Have BOTH):

**1. Source of Infection (known or suspected):**
- Pneumonia/cough
- UTI/urinary symptoms
- Skin infection
- Immunosuppressed

**PLUS**

**2. Any TWO of These Four:**
- Altered mental status (GCS < 13)
- Systolic BP < 100
- Respiratory rate > 22
- Temp > 100.4°F (38°C) or < 97°F (36°C)

---

## Management Summary

**If Sepsis Criteria Met:**

✓ **Cardiac monitor**  
✓ **Oxygen if SpO₂ <95%** (high-flow)  
✓ **IV access**  
✓ **Fluids if BP <100** (NS 250 mL boluses, max 1L, if lungs clear)  
✓ **Stop fluids** if rales develop  
✓ **Base Hospital** if BP <90 after 1L or CHF develops (push-dose epi)  
✓ **ALS escort**  
✓ **Early notification** to receiving facility  

---

## Key Points

**Sepsis is Time-Critical:**
- Early recognition crucial
- Early notification to hospital
- Allows hospital to prepare (labs, antibiotics, ICU)
- Mortality increases with delays

**Fluid Resuscitation:**
- Critical early intervention
- BP < 100 is threshold to start
- 250 mL boluses, reassess
- Maximum 1 liter in field
- Monitor lung sounds

**High-Risk Populations:**
- Elderly
- Immunosuppressed
- Chronic disease (diabetes, renal failure)
- Nursing home residents

**Atypical Presentations:**
- "Nonspecific illness"
- Weakness, dizziness
- Altered mental status
- May not have fever

---

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Missing sepsis in "weak and dizzy" calls** - consider infection source  
❌ **Not checking for infection source** - ask about cough, urinary symptoms, skin issues  
❌ **Waiting for fever** - may be absent, especially in elderly  
❌ **Giving fluids with CHF** - check lung sounds  
❌ **Not notifying hospital early** - early notification critical  
❌ **Undertreating hypotension** - may need full liter
