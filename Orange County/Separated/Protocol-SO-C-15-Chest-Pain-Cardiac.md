## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Monitor Cardiac Rhythm

Continuous cardiac monitoring throughout patient contact.

---

### 2. 12-Lead ECG

**Obtain 12-lead ECG as soon as possible prior to leaving scene**; if acute MI indicated or suspected, make Base Hospital contact for CVRC destination with cardiac catheterization lab open and available.

---

### 3. Administer Aspirin

Administer aspirin if **none** of the following contraindications exists:

#### Contraindications to Aspirin:
- ○ If pain directly in the mid-back, mid-line region, hold aspirin as this may be a symptom of a dissecting aorta, particularly in a patient with a history of hypertension.
- ○ Patient is on anticoagulant ("blood thinners") medication such as Coumadin, Pradaxa®, Effient®, and Lovenox® or antiplatelet medications such as Plavix®.
- ○ Patient reports history of aspirin allergy

#### Aspirin Dose:
**► Aspirin 4 (four) 81 mg chewable tablets (chew) or one 325 mg regular tablet to chew.**

---

### 4. Pulse Oximetry

If room air O₂ Saturation less than 95%:

**► Administer oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow rate, as tolerated.**

---

### 5. Nitroglycerin for Suspected Cardiac Pain

For initial management of suspected cardiac pain give:

**► Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL if systolic BP above 100 mm/Hg; repeat approximately every 3 minutes for continued discomfort; maximum total of 3 doses if systolic BP above 100 mm/Hg**

(Do not include possible doses patient took prior to ALS arrival as part of 3 EMS doses).

---

### 6. Pain Management

If pain unrelieved with 3 doses of nitroglycerin or nitroglycerin cannot be administered, give:

**► Morphine Sulfate: 5 mg (or 4 mg carpuject) IV, may repeat once after approximately 3 minutes** (hold if BP less than or drops below 90 systolic)

**OR**

**Fentanyl 50 mcg IV, may repeat once after approximately 3 minutes for continued pain** (hold if BP less than or drops below 90 systolic).

---

### 7. Antiemetic

For nausea or vomiting and not known or suspected to be pregnant:

**► Ondansetron (Zofran®): ODT 8 mg (two 4 mg tablets) orally to dissolve inside of cheek, once;**  
**OR,**  
**4 mg IV, may repeat 4 mg IV in approximately 3 minutes if symptoms persist.**

---

### 8. Base Hospital Contact

Contact Base Hospital if acute MI (STEMI) for CVRC Destination or if acute MI not suspected, paramedic escort to an appropriate ERC.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION

**CAUTION: AN ECG THAT IS "NORMAL" OR NEGATIVE FOR STEMI DOES NOT RULE OUT AN ACUTE MI OR SERIOUS ANGINA.**

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### 12-Lead ECG Interpretation and CVRC Triage

The following 12-lead monitor interpretations should be triaged to a CVRC:

1. **\*\*\*ACUTE MI\*\*\***
2. **\*\*\*STEMI\*\*\***
3. **Acute ST Elevation Infarct**
4. **Probable Acute ST Elevation Infarct**
5. **Acute Infarction**
6. **Infarct, Probably Acute**
7. **Infarct, Possible Acute**

---

### Nitroglycerin and ED Medications

**Do not administer nitroglycerin** if Viagra® (sildenafil), Levitra® (vardenafil), or Cialis® (tadalafil) were used by the patient in the past 24 hours.

**Important Drug Interaction:**
- These erectile dysfunction medications can cause severe hypotension when combined with nitroglycerin
- Always ask about use before administering nitroglycerin
- Document response if patient used these medications

---

### IV Access Considerations for CVRC Patients

**Intraosseous lines should be avoided** for potential CVRC patients because such lines may allow for uncontrolled bleeding without the ability to compress the bleeding site if a patient receives thrombolytics.

**Preferred Access:**
- Peripheral IV (preferred)
- External jugular if necessary
- Avoid IO unless no other option available

---

### Angina Equivalent Symptoms

Angina equivalent symptoms can include, but are not limited to:

- **Unexplained sweating or diaphoresis**
- **Sudden onset of general weakness**
- **Unexplained shortness of breath**
- **Anxiety, or vague feeling of panic**

**Key Points:**
- May occur with or without chest pain/pressure
- Often seen in diabetics, elderly, women
- Should be treated with same urgency as chest pain
- Still requires 12-lead ECG

---

### Field 12-Lead ECG Criteria

**Chest discomfort** presenting as heartburn, pleuritic, or musculoskeletal pain does not rule out heart disease or acute MI. 

**A field 12-lead ECG should be obtained as soon as possible**, preferably prior to leaving scene, on any adult 45 years-old or greater who complains of the following symptoms:

- **Known history of heart disease** with chest pain, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or syncope-weakness.
- **Chest pain or chest discomfort** (unrelated to injury or strain) as chief symptom.
- **Radiation of chest pain or chest discomfort** to arm, shoulder, neck, jaw or back.
- **Diaphoresis.**

---

### Base Hospital Contact and AMA

**Base hospital contact should be made prior to leaving scene** for all patients who have a 12-lead performed and elect to sign out AMA.

**Important:**
- Patient with suspected cardiac symptoms refusing transport is high risk
- Base Hospital physician should speak directly with patient when possible
- Document all attempts to convince patient to accept transport
- Provide clear documentation of risks explained to patient

---

## Special Considerations

### LifeVest® Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillator

If a patient is wearing a **LifeVest®**:

- **Proceed with standard evaluation and treatment measures.**

- **CPR can be performed** as long as the device is not broadcasting, "press the response buttons," or "electrical shock possible, do not touch patient," or "bystanders do not interfere."

- **If external defibrillation is available**, remove the LifeVest® and monitor/treat the patient with the external equipment. Providers can defibrillate with the vest in place AFTER disconnecting the battery.

- **To remove the LifeVest®**, first pull out the battery, then remove the garment from the patient.

- **Take vest, modem, charger, and extra battery to the hospital.**

## Clinical Decision Support

### When to Suspect Cardiac Origin

**High Suspicion (CVRC Consideration):**
- Age ≥ 45 years with chest discomfort
- Known cardiac history
- Radiation to arm, jaw, neck, back
- Associated with exertion
- Diaphoresis
- Nausea/vomiting
- Shortness of breath
- Syncope or near-syncope

**Angina Equivalents (Especially in Diabetics/Elderly/Women):**
- Unexplained weakness
- Sudden dyspnea
- Diaphoresis without pain
- Epigastric discomfort
- Anxiety or sense of doom

---

### ECG Findings Requiring CVRC

**Automatic Interpretations That Trigger CVRC:**
- \*\*\*ACUTE MI\*\*\*
- \*\*\*STEMI\*\*\*
- Acute ST Elevation Infarct
- Probable Acute ST Elevation Infarct
- Acute Infarction
- Infarct, Probably Acute
- Infarct, Possible Acute

**Manual Review Still Required:**
- Computer interpretation can miss STEMI
- Posterior MI (look for tall R waves V1-V2)
- Right ventricular MI (right-sided leads)
- LBBB with Sgarbossa criteria

---

### Aortic Dissection Warning Signs

**Suspect Aortic Dissection If:**
- Pain directly in mid-back, mid-line region
- "Tearing" or "ripping" quality
- Sudden onset maximal intensity
- History of hypertension
- Pulse differential between arms
- Blood pressure differential between arms

**Management if Suspected:**
- **DO NOT give aspirin**
- **DO NOT give nitroglycerin** (may worsen)
- Maintain blood pressure
- Rapid transport
- Base Hospital contact

---

## Documentation Requirements

### Required Elements:
- Chief complaint and onset time
- Cardiac risk factors
- Current medications (especially anticoagulants, ED meds)
- 12-lead ECG interpretation and time
- Aspirin administration and contraindications checked
- Nitroglycerin doses and times
- Pain scale (0-10) before and after interventions
- Blood pressure before and after medications
- Base Hospital contact and destination
- Patient response to treatment

### Quality Metrics:
- Time from patient contact to 12-lead ECG
- Time from 12-lead to Base Hospital contact (if STEMI)
- Door-to-balloon time (hospital metric)
- Aspirin given (unless contraindicated)
- Appropriate CVRC vs ERC destination

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **12-lead ECG as soon as possible** - preferably before leaving scene  
✓ **Time is muscle** - rapid identification and transport critical  
✓ **Aspirin unless contraindicated** - check for anticoagulants  
✓ **Normal ECG does not rule out MI** - clinical judgment essential  
✓ **Angina equivalents** count - especially in diabetics, elderly, women  
✓ **Base Hospital for STEMI** - CVRC with cath lab open  
✓ **No nitroglycerin with ED meds** - ask about Viagra/Levitra/Cialis  
✓ **Avoid IO in potential CVRC patients** - bleeding risk with thrombolytics  
✓ **Mid-back pain** - think aortic dissection, hold aspirin  
✓ **AMA refusal with 12-lead** - requires Base Hospital contact

### Pulmonary Embolism
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Hypoxia
- Recent surgery/immobility

### Tension Pneumothorax
- Unilateral decreased breath sounds
- Tracheal deviation
- Hypotension
