## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Airway and Ventilation

**Assist ventilation with BVM and suction airway as needed.**

---

### 2. Oxygen Therapy

**Pulse oximetry, if room air oxygen saturation less than 95%, administer:**

**► High-flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 l/min flow rate as tolerated.**

---

### 3. Blood Glucose Assessment

**Blood glucose analysis, if blood glucose less than 60 (or if 60-80 and suspect hypoglycemia), administer one of:**

**► Oral glucose preparation, if tolerated and airway reflexes are intact.**

**► 10% Dextrose 250 mL IV**

**► Glucagon 1.0 mg IM if unable to establish IV.**

**NOTE:** IO access may be used for dextrose administration when patient is unconscious with blood glucose < 80, unable to establish IV and there is no response to IM glucagon.

---

### 4. Fluid Resuscitation

**For blood pressure less than 90 systolic and lungs clear to auscultation:**

**► Establish IV access**

**► Normal Saline, infuse 250 mL IV, repeat up to maximum 1 liter to maintain adequate perfusion**

---

## Proceed with Appropriate Management as Listed Below:

---

## Suspected Narcotic Overdose

**→ If respiratory depression (respiratory rate less than or equal to 12 minute), give:**

**►Naloxone (Narcan®):**

**□ 0.8, 1 or 2 mg IN or IM, repeat every 3 minutes as needed to maintain respiratory rate.**

**□ 0.4-1 mg IV, every 3 minutes as needed to maintain respiratory rate.**

**□ 4 mg/0.1 mL preloaded nasal spray IN**

---

## Suspected Stimulant Intoxication

**→ If agitated and a danger to self or others, sedate with:**

**► Midazolam 5 mg IV/IM once.**

**→ If on-going or recurrent seizure activity:**

**► Turn to side, protect airway and suction when necessary**

**► Midazolam 10 mg IM one time (preferred route). Administer first before starting IV/IO**

**► Midazolam 5 mg IV/IN/IO if not able to deliver IM dose or if IV/IO already present; may repeat 5 mg IV/IN/IO once for continued or recurrent seizure activity approximately 3 minutes after initial dose.**

**► Contact Base Hospital if seizure continues for 5 minutes after first dose IM or second dose IV/IN/IO of midazolam (total of 10 mg administered by any route).**

**→ Monitor for respiratory adequacy via constant visual monitoring and pulse oximetry: If sudden hypoventilation, oxygen desaturation (per pulse oximetry), or apnea:**

**►Assist ventilation with BVM (intubate as time permits),**

**→ Monitor for hyperthermia; initiate cooling measures if appears to have hyperthermia.**

**→ If signs of dehydration or poor perfusion and lungs clear to auscultation (no evidence CHF):**

**►Establish IV access and give 250 mL Normal Saline bolus, may repeat up to maximum 1 liter to maintain adequate perfusion.**

**→ If continuous nausea or vomiting, and not suspected or known to be pregnant:**

**►Ondansetron (Zofran®): ODT 8 mg (two 4 mg tablets) to dissolve orally on inside of cheek; OR, 4 mg IV, may repeat 4mg IV after approximately 3 minutes for continued nausea or vomiting.**

---

## Suspected Organophosphate Poisoning (Including Chemical Agents)

**►Atropine 2 mg IV, repeat once as needed, alternate route 2 mg IM, repeat once as needed. (For DuoDote® Kit instructions and dosing during health emergencies or disaster, refer to Procedure B-35).**

**→ For wheezes or bronchospasm:**

**► Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6.0 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated.**

**► CPAP if available as tolerated and if not contraindicated (reference PR-120).**

**→ For on-going or recurrent seizure activity:**

**► Midazolam as directed under Stimulant Intoxication.**

---

## Suspected Cyanide Toxicity (OR Inhalation of Smoke Generated by Plastics, Hydrocarbons)

**► High flow oxygen by mask**

**►Cardiac monitor and document rhythm.**

**► Hydroxocobalamin (if available, PR-130) 5 gm/200 mL solution IV/IO over 15 minutes.**

**→For wheezes or bronchospasm:**

**► Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6.0 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated.**

**► CPAP if available as tolerated and if not contraindicated (reference PR-120).**

**→For on-going or recurrent seizure activity:**

**►Midazolam as directed under Stimulant Intoxication.**

---

## Suspected Carbon Monoxide Toxicity

**(Requires base hospital order.)**

**► High flow oxygen by mask**

**►Cardiac monitor and document rhythm.**

**→For wheezes or bronchospasm:**

**► Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6.0 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated.**

**► CPAP if available as tolerated and if not contraindicated (reference PR-120).**

**→For on-going or recurrent seizure activity:**

**►Midazolam as directed under Stimulant Intoxication.**

---

## Suspected Extrapyramidal Reaction

**►Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) 50 mg IM or IV once.**

---

### 5. Transport

**ALS escort any of above patients to the nearest ERC or contact Base Hospital as needed.**
