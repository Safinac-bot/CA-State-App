### Clinical Pearls
- Pure opioid receptor antagonist
- Reverses all opioid effects
- Onset: IV (1-2 min), IM (5-10 min), IN (3-5 min)
- Duration: 30-90 minutes (shorter than most opioids)
- May need repeated doses
- Can precipitate acute withdrawal
- Be prepared for combative patient
- Patient may refuse transport after revival
- Titrate to adequate respirations (not full reversal)
- Duration shorter than most opioids - monitor closely

### Indications
- Respiratory depression from opioid overdose
- Altered mental status from opioid overdose
- Suspected opioid overdose with:
  - Respiratory rate ≤ 12/min
  - Decreased level of consciousness
  - Pinpoint pupils

### Contraindications
- Known hypersensitivity to naloxone (rare)
- No opioid ingestion (won't harm, but won't help)

### Precautions
- May precipitate acute opioid withdrawal
- Patient may become combative/violent
- Pulmonary edema reported with rapid reversal
- Pain will return with opioid reversal
- Duration shorter than most opioids (re-sedation possible)

- Protect patient and crew safety

### Opioid Withdrawal Symptoms
- Agitation, combativeness
- Nausea, vomiting
- Diaphoresis
- Tachycardia
- Hypertension
- Dilated pupils
- Muscle aches
- Anxiety

### Dosing Strategy
**Goal:** Restore adequate respirations, NOT full consciousness

**Titration Approach:**
1. Start with lower doses (0.4 mg)
2. Assess respiratory response
3. Repeat if inadequate
4. Goal: RR > 10/min with adequate depth
5. Avoid precipitating severe withdrawal

**High-Dose Opioid Exposure:**
- Fentanyl, carfentanil may require multiple doses
- May need 4-10 mg total
- Repeat dosing every 2-3 minutes
- Consider IM route for longer duration if transporting

### Special Considerations

#### Synthetic Opioids (Fentanyl, Carfentanil):
- May require very high naloxone doses
- Multiple doses expected
- Duration of opioid may exceed naloxone
- Transport mandatory (cannot refuse)
- Continuous monitoring essential

#### Chronic Opioid Users:
- Lower doses to avoid severe withdrawal
- Titrate carefully
- Patient may refuse transport
- Document thoroughly
- Encourage emergency department evaluation

#### Polydrug Overdose:
- May have other CNS depressants on board
- Naloxone only reverses opioids
- May still have altered mental status
- Benzodiazepines, alcohol NOT reversed
- Transport strongly recommended

### Monitoring Requirements
- Respiratory rate and depth
- Oxygen saturation
- Level of consciousness
- Pupil size
- Cardiac rhythm
- Blood pressure
- Behavior/agitation level
- Signs of re-sedation

### Documentation
- Signs and symptoms of overdose
- Naloxone dose, route, time
- Response to naloxone

## Emergency Medication Guidelines

### Anaphylaxis Treatment Protocol

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Remove trigger** if possible (stop medication, remove stinger)
2. **Assess ABCs** - airway, breathing, circulation
3. **Call for help** - additional resources
4. **Position patient** - supine with legs elevated (if no respiratory distress)

#### Medication Sequence:
1. **Epinephrine 1:1,000 IM** (0.5 mg lateral thigh)
   - FIRST and MOST IMPORTANT
   - Do NOT delay for IV access
   
2. **High-flow oxygen** (maintain SpO₂ > 94%)

3. **Establish IV access** (normal saline bolus if hypotensive)

4. **Albuterol nebulizer** if wheezing (continuous if needed)

5. **Diphenhydramine** 50 mg IV/IM

6. **Consider Epinephrine IV** if no response to IM (0.3 mg slow IV)

#### Signs of Anaphylaxis:
- **Respiratory:** Wheezing, stridor, dyspnea, chest tightness
- **Cardiovascular:** Hypotension, tachycardia, shock
- **Skin:** Urticaria (hives), angioedema, flushing
- **GI:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping
- **Neurologic:** Anxiety, sense of doom, altered mental status

#### Severity Classification:
**Mild:** Skin symptoms only (urticaria, flushing)  
**Moderate:** Multiple system involvement  
**Severe:** Hypotension, severe bronchospasm, airway compromise

### Opioid Overdose Protocol

#### Scene Safety:
- Ensure scene is safe
- Consider fentanyl exposure risk to responders
- Use appropriate PPE
- Avoid aerosolizing substances

#### Assessment:
- **Classic Triad:**
  1. Decreased level of consciousness
  2. Respiratory depression (RR < 12)
  3. Pinpoint pupils

#### Treatment:
1. **Airway management** - position, suction, airway adjuncts
2. **Ventilatory support** - BVM if inadequate respirations
3. **Oxygen** - high-flow
4. **Naloxone** - titrated to respiratory effort
5. **IV access** - if possible
6. **Cardiac monitoring**
7. **Prepare for patient agitation**

#### After Naloxone:
- **Monitor continuously** (re-sedation possible)
- **Encourage transport** (mandatory if synthetic opioids)
- **Document refusals** thoroughly if patient refuses
- **Leave naloxone** with patient if available and refusing (per protocol)

### Hypoglycemia Protocol

#### Blood Glucose Threshold:
- **< 60 mg/dL:** Treat regardless of symptoms
- **60-80 mg/dL:** Treat if symptomatic

#### Treatment Options (In Order):
1. **If alert and able to swallow:** Oral glucose
2. **If IV access:** Dextrose 10% or 25%
3. **If no IV access:** Glucagon 1 mg IM

#### After Treatment:
- Recheck glucose in 10-15 minutes
- Give complex carbohydrates when alert
- Determine cause of hypoglycemia
- Assess medication compliance
- Check for illness/infection
