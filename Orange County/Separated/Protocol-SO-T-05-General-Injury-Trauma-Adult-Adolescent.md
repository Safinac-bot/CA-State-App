## ALS STANDING ORDERS:

### AUTO ACCIDENT WITH AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT:

**1. For Eye Irritation:**

- Brush off any powder around upper face and irrigate copiously with water.
- Ask patient if wearing contact lenses and if yes, ask patient to remove lenses if still in place.

**2. Pulse Oximetry; if Oxygen Saturation Less Than 95% Give:**

**►High-flow oxygen by mask; or nasal cannula at 6 l/min flow rate as tolerated.**

**3. For Respiratory Distress with Wheezes, Administer Albuterol:**

**►Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6.0 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated.**

**4. Make Base Contact for Any Patient Who Meets Trauma Triage Criteria (OCEMS Policy #310.30)**

**5. If Does Not Meet Trauma Triage Criteria, Transport to Nearest Available ERC (ALS Escort if Albuterol Required for Stabilization).**

---

### EXTERNAL BLEEDING / HEMORRHAGE:

**1. Apply Direct Pressure to Bleeding Site to Control Blood Loss**

- For continued bleeding after application of direct pressure, consider use of approved hemostatic dressing.
- Use of a tourniquet is appropriate when upper or lower extremity hemorrhage cannot be controlled by applying direct pressure or hemostatic dressing to the site of bleeding.
- Make base contact for any patient who meets Trauma Triage Criteria (OCEMS Policy # 310.30).

**2. Pulse Oximetry; if Oxygen Saturation Less Than 95% Give:**

**►High-flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 l/min flow rate as tolerated.**

**3. IV Access if Hypotensive or Per Paramedic Judgment, Do Not Delay Transport to Establish IVs.**

**►250 mL Normal Saline IV, continue Normal Saline as a wide open infusion to maintain perfusion.**

**4. Base Contact Required if Hypotensive or Normal Saline Infusion Required for Stabilization.**

---

### EYE INJURY:

**1. Cover Injured Eye Without Applying Pressure to the Globe.**

**2. Elevate Head 30 Degrees or More if Spinal Motion Restriction is Not Required.**

**3. Morphine Sulfate or Fentanyl as Needed for Pain, if BP Greater Than 90 Systolic:**

**► Morphine sulfate 5 mg (or 4 mg carpuject) IV/IM, may repeat once in 3 minutes to control pain;**

**OR,**

**Fentanyl 50 mcg IV/IM or Fentanyl 100 mcg IN, may repeat once in 3 minutes to control pain.**

## GENERAL INJURY AND TRAUMA – ADULT/ADOLESCENT (Page 2 of 3)

**4. For Nausea or Vomiting, and Not Suspected or Known to Be Pregnant:**

**► Ondansetron (Zofran™) 8 mg (two 4 mg ODT tablets) to dissolve orally on inside of cheek**

**OR**

**4 mg IV, may repeat 4 mg IV once after approximately 3 minutes for continued nausea or vomiting.**

**5. Transport to Nearest Available ERC (ALS Escort if Medications Required).**

---

### ISOLATED EXTREMITY TRAUMA (Fractures or Amputations) NOT MEETING TRAUMA TRIAGE CRITERIA:

**1. Splint or Immobilize Fractured Extremities (Note Any Breaks of Skin or Open Wounds).**

**2. May Place Cold Packs Over Splinted Fracture Sites for Comfort.**

**3. Morphine Sulfate or Fentanyl as Needed for Pain, if BP Greater Than 90 Systolic:**

**►Morphine sulfate 5 mg (or 4 mg carpuject) IV/IM, may repeat once in 3 minutes to control pain;**

**OR,**

**Fentanyl 50 mcg IV/IM or Fentanyl 100 mcg IN, may repeat once in 3 minutes to control pain**

**4. Transport to Nearest Available ERC (ALS Escort if Morphine or Fentanyl Given).**

---

### IMPALED OBJECTS NOT MEETING TRAUMA TRIAGE CRITERIA:

**1. Stabilize Impaled Object in Place When Possible Unless This Causes a Delay in Extrication or Transport.**

**2. DO NOT Remove Impaled Objects in Face or Neck Unless Ventilation is Compromised.**

**3. Morphine Sulfate or Fentanyl as Needed for Pain, if BP Greater Than 90 Systolic:**

**►Morphine sulfate 5 mg (or 4 mg carpuject) IV/IM, may repeat once in 3 minutes to control pain;**

**OR,**

**Fentanyl 50 mcg IV/IM or Fentanyl 100 mcg IN, may repeat once in 3 minutes to control pain.**

**4. Transport to Nearest Available ERC (ALS Escort if Morphine or Fentanyl Given).**

---

### SUSPECTED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI):

**1. Monitor All Patients with Continuous Pulse Oximetry.**

**► Provide supplemental oxygen via nasal canula at 6 L/min flow rate or high flow oxygen by face mask and maintain P.O. > 90%.**

- **If unable to maintain P.O. > 90% with oxygen alone, reposition airway as appropriate (consider c-spine precautions). If P.O. now > 90%, continue monitoring.**
- **If P.O. still < 90%, deliver positive pressure ventilation with bag-valve-mask in conjunction with airway adjuncts. If P.O. now > 90%, continue monitoring.**

## GENERAL INJURY AND TRAUMA – ADULT/ADOLESCENT (Page 3 of 3)

- **If P.O. still < 90%, place a supraglottic airway or endotracheal tube if possible. Continue monitoring.**

**2. Monitor All Patients with Continuous End Tidal CO2.**

**► Maintain ETCO2 between 35 and 45 mmHg if possible, especially for ventilated patients.**

**3. Monitor Systolic Blood Pressure for All Patients Every 5 Minutes.**

**‣ If systolic blood pressure drops below 100 mmHg, administer 250 mL Normal Saline IV, and continue as a wide open infusion to maintain systolic BP > 100 mmHg.**

**For patients 65 years of age or older, initiate IV fluids when blood pressure drops below 110 mmHg, with goal of maintaining systolic BP > 110 mmHg.**

**4. Assess GCS in All Patients.**

**► In patients with a GCS of 8 or less, establish an airway by the most appropriate means available.**

**5. Transport to Trauma Center**

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES:

### GENERAL:

- When transporting women on a backboard who are estimated to be 20 weeks or more gestation (2nd and 3rd trimester) tilt the backboard to the patient's left to maintain a modified left-lateral position.
- Base contact is required for any patient meeting Trauma Triage Criteria to determine appropriate receiving PTRC.

---

### AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT:

- Watch for side airbag or secondary airbag deployment.
- Consider potential for eye injuries, blunt force trauma chest injuries.

---

### ISOLATED SKELETAL TRAUMA (Fractures or Amputations) NOT MEETING TRAUMA TRIAGE CRITERIA:

- For extremity fractures, always note presence or absence of peripheral pulses and sensation.
