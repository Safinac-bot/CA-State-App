## BLS ACTIONS/TREATMENT:

- If avulsed tissue is still attached, return to normal position and secure with moist saline dressing.
- Stop profuse bleeding with direct point pressure to site of bleeding.
- For bleeding that cannot be controlled by direct pressure, apply OCEMS approved tourniquet tightened incrementally to least amount of pressure required to stop or limit bleeding.
- Make every effort to retrieve all amputated parts and tissue.
- Rinse amputated part with normal saline solution to remove any gross contamination, then wrap in sterile saline moistened gauze.
- Place wrapped part inside a waterproof container, if available; utilize cold pack to keep container cold.
  - Amputated part / tissue should not be placed directly into ice (the melting ice produces a hypotonic solution that damages cells).
  - Do not use dry ice.
- Transport amputated part / tissue with patient.
