## INDICATION:

Ketamine is indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain (Pain Scale 4-10) when the patient needs pain medicine during treatment by paramedics. It should be administered when the patient can't tolerate narcotics or refuses them, the patient is hypotensive, or the patient's airway/ventilatory status may be at risk. Ketamine may be administered either by the IV, IM, or IN route.

## CONTRAINDICATIONS:

- History of psychosis (schizophrenia)
- Pregnancy
- Known allergy to ketamine
- Age < 15
- Concurrent alcohol or drug intoxication - this is a relative contraindication. If the intoxication is not significant and they are not lethargic or otherwise impaired, ketamine can be authorized after base hospital contact.
- GCS < 14

## PROCEDURE:

1. Confirm that administering fentanyl would not be safe or appropriate choice when the patient is suffering from moderate to severe pain.

2. Confirm that the patient has no contraindications to receiving ketamine.

3. Standing Order: administer ketamine either IV, IM or IN after aspirating the correct dose from a vial containing ketamine in an appropriate concentration for IV, IM or IN administration.

   - **For IV injection,** the ketamine dose is 0.1 mg/kg slow IV push over one to two minutes with maximum dose of 10.0 mg. May repeat one time in 15 minutes.

   - **For IM injection,** the ketamine dose is 0.5 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 50 mg. May repeat one time in 15 minutes.

   - **For IN administration,** the ketamine dose is 1.0 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 100 mg.

4. While the IV, IM, or IN route can be used, IV injection provides more immediate relief to the patient and is the preferred method of choice. If an IV injection is not possible or practical, use IM or IN.
