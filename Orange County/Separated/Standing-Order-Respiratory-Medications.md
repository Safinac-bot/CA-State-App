## Albuterol

### Medication Information
**Generic Name:** Albuterol (Salbutamol)  
**Class:** Beta-2 Adrenergic Agonist, Bronchodilator

### Formulations and Standing Orders

#### Formulation 1: Nebulized Solution
**Form:** 2.5mg/3 mL solution  
**Route:** Nebulized oral inhalation  
**Indication(s):**
1. Wheezing
2. Known asthma or COPD with decreased breath sounds and labored breathing
3. Smoke inhalation with wheezing
4. Crush injury for elevated serum potassium control

**Standing Order:** Continuous nebulization of 6 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated

#### Formulation 2: Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI)
**Form:** Metered dose inhaler (90 mcg albuterol base) single patient use  
**Route:** Oral inhaled  
**Indication(s):**
1. Wheezing
2. Known asthma or COPD with decreased breath sounds and labored breathing
3. Smoke inhalation with wheezing
4. Crush injury for elevated serum potassium control

**Standing Order:** 2 puffs inhaled every 2 hours until symptoms clear; Single patient use inhaler

### Clinical Pearls
- Beta-2 selective bronchodilator
- Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle
- Onset of action: 5-15 minutes (nebulized), 5 minutes (MDI)
- Duration: 3-6 hours
- Continuous nebulization preferred for severe bronchospasm
- MDI requires proper technique and coordination
- Use spacer device when available with MDI
- Monitor for tachycardia and tremor
- May lower serum potassium

### Contraindications
- Known hypersensitivity to albuterol
- Tachycardia unrelated to respiratory distress (relative)

### Precautions
- May cause tachycardia and palpitations
- Use caution in cardiac patients
- Can cause tremor and nervousness
- May cause hypokalemia with repeated doses
- Monitor heart rate and rhythm
- Paradoxical bronchospasm possible (rare)

### Monitoring
- Respiratory rate and effort
- Breath sounds
- Oxygen saturation
- Heart rate and rhythm
- Blood pressure
- Level of consciousness
- Patient anxiety level

### Expected Response
- Decreased wheezing
- Improved air movement
- Decreased work of breathing
- Improved oxygen saturation
- Relief of dyspnea

## Oxygen

### Medication Information
**Generic Name:** Oxygen (O₂)  
**Class:** Medical Gas

### Formulations and Standing Orders

#### Formulation 1: High Flow Oxygen
**Form:** Gas  
**Route:** Mask / Nasal Cannula  
**Indication(s):**
1. Suspected hypoxia or O₂ Saturation < 95%
2. Smoke inhalation
3. Suspected carbon monoxide toxicity
4. Near-fatal drowning
5. SCUBA diving accidents

**Standing Order:** High flow oxygen by mask (preferred), 10 L/min flow rate or nasal cannula, 6 L/min flow rate

#### Formulation 2: Home Oxygen Maintenance
**Form:** Gas  
**Route:** Nasal Cannula  
**Indication:** Patient on chronic oxygen therapy (home O₂)  
**Standing Order:** Maintain home O₂ flow rate

### Clinical Pearls
- Essential for cellular metabolism
- Increases oxygen content in blood
- Reduces work of breathing
- Non-flammable but supports combustion
- High flow preferred for acute emergencies
- Titrate to maintain SpO₂ ≥ 94% in most patients
- COPD patients: Target SpO₂ 88-92% if chronic CO₂ retention
- Nasal cannula: 1-6 L/min (24-44% FiO₂)
- Non-rebreather mask: 10-15 L/min (60-90% FiO₂)
- Simple face mask: 6-10 L/min (35-60% FiO₂)

### Indications for High-Flow Oxygen
- Cardiac arrest
- Shock states
- Trauma with suspected hypoxia
- Acute respiratory distress
- Chest pain of cardiac origin
- Carbon monoxide poisoning
- Severe anemia
- Decompression illness

### Oxygen Delivery Devices

#### Nasal Cannula
- **Flow Rate:** 1-6 L/min
- **FiO₂:** 24-44%
- **Best For:** Stable patients, chronic oxygen users
- **Advantages:** Comfortable, allows eating/talking
- **Disadvantages:** Lower FiO₂, drying to nasal passages

#### Simple Face Mask
- **Flow Rate:** 6-10 L/min
- **FiO₂:** 35-60%
- **Best For:** Moderate hypoxia
- **Advantages:** Higher FiO₂ than cannula
- **Disadvantages:** Less comfortable, interferes with talking

#### Non-Rebreather Mask
- **Flow Rate:** 10-15 L/min
- **FiO₂:** 60-90%
- **Best For:** Severe hypoxia, critical patients
- **Advantages:** Highest FiO₂ of standard devices
- **Disadvantages:** Requires good mask seal, reservoir must stay inflated

#### Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM)
- **Flow Rate:** 15 L/min
- **FiO₂:** Nearly 100% (with reservoir)
- **Best For:** Assisted/controlled ventilation
- **Advantages:** Highest FiO₂, controls ventilation
- **Disadvantages:** Requires two-person technique for optimal seal

### Special Considerations

#### Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
- Use highest available oxygen concentration
- Non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min
- Consider hyperbaric oxygen if available
- Do not rely on pulse oximetry (falsely elevated)
- Continue high-flow oxygen during transport

#### COPD Patients
- May have chronic CO₂ retention
- Target SpO₂ 88-92% (not higher)
- Start with controlled oxygen delivery
- Monitor respiratory rate and mental status
- Risk of respiratory depression with high FiO₂
- Never withhold oxygen in acute emergency

#### Smoke Inhalation
- High-flow oxygen mandatory
- Suspect carbon monoxide poisoning
- Assess for airway burns
- Monitor for respiratory distress
- Consider early intubation if stridor or burns

### Contraindications
- None in emergency situations
- Relative: Paraquat poisoning, bleomycin therapy (risk of pulmonary toxicity)

### Precautions
- Fire hazard - ensure no smoking/flames
- Secure cylinders during transport
- Monitor tank pressure
- Have backup oxygen supply
- Dry mucous membranes with prolonged use
- Oxygen toxicity with prolonged high FiO₂ (>48-72 hours)

### Monitoring
- Oxygen saturation (SpO₂)
- Respiratory rate and pattern
- Work of breathing
- Level of consciousness
- Skin color and perfusion
- Tank pressure/supply

### Documentation
- Oxygen delivery device
- Flow rate (L/min)
- Initial SpO₂
- Response to oxygen therapy
- Changes in respiratory status
- Patient tolerance

- Current medications
- Allergies

### Monitoring During Treatment
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Frequent vital signs
- Breath sounds before and after treatment
- Work of breathing
- Patient subjective response
- Adverse effects

### Signs of Respiratory Distress
- Tachypnea or bradypnea
- Use of accessory muscles
- Nasal flaring
- Tripod positioning
- Inability to speak in full sentences
- Altered mental status
- Cyanosis
- Decreased oxygen saturation

### When to Contact Base Hospital
- Inadequate response to treatment
- Worsening respiratory distress
- Need for additional bronchodilator doses
- Consideration for advanced airway
- Questions about treatment plan
- Unusual presentations

### Combination Therapy
**Severe Bronchospasm:**
- High-flow oxygen
- Continuous albuterol nebulization
- Consider epinephrine for anaphylaxis
- Position of comfort (usually upright)
- Calm, reassuring approach

**Respiratory Failure:**
- High-flow oxygen
- Consider CPAP/BiPAP if available
- Assisted ventilation as needed
- Prepare for possible intubation
- Rapid transport

## Special Populations

### Elderly Patients
- May have decreased response to bronchodilators
- Higher risk of cardiac side effects
- Often have multiple comorbidities
- May need lower albuterol doses if significant cardiac disease

### Pediatric Considerations
- Refer to pediatric drug guide for specific dosing
- Children often respond well to bronchodilators
- May need modified delivery techniques
- Anxiety can worsen respiratory distress

### Pregnant Patients
- Albuterol is Category C (generally safe)
- Oxygen requirements may be higher
- Normal pregnancy causes mild dyspnea
- Increased risk of pre-eclampsia with respiratory symptoms
