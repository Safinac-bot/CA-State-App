## Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) OR Pulseless Wide Complex Tachycardia (VT)

### 1. Initial Management

Initiate an organized CPR management approach with responders placed in designated positions around the patient and continue high quality CPR without interruption of continuous compressions unless pulse obtained during any step below:

**a.** If cardiopulmonary arrest was witnessed by bystanders or EMS personnel, consider passive ventilation procedure (OCEMS PR-025) for a total of 6 minutes; otherwise use BVM/ETCO2 sensor for initial ventilation or other non-endotracheal airway unless endotracheal tube is clearly indicated (example: laryngeal edema from smoke inhalation)

**b.** If possible at scene, elevate patient head to 30 degrees semi-fowlers position

**c.** Continue chest compressions for a total of 200 compressions (approximately 2 minutes), then reassess

---

### 2. After 2 Minutes of High Quality CPR

Identify rhythm:

**a.** If rhythm is coarse VF/pulseless Wide Complex Tachycardia and defibrillator is available: **Defibrillate once at maximum energy setting** or pre-programmed/manufacturer's recommended defibrillator setting

**b.** If rhythm is fine ventricular fibrillation: Continue compressions for 2 minutes then reassess

---

### 3. If Rhythm with Pulse Develops (ROSC)

**a.** Ventilate and oxygenate (BVM or high flow oxygen as appropriate)

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### High Quality CPR Principles

Priority in cardiopulmonary arrest management emphasizes **high quality CPR with minimal interruptions of chest compressions**. To maintain high quality CPR without interruption of continuous compressions, personnel should rotate through the compressor position every 2 minutes.

**High Quality CPR Includes:**

1. Use of a CPR feedback device that can provide immediate feedback on compression depth, rate, and proper recoil; OR

2. Placement of an automatic chest compression device (ACCD)

---

### Automatic Chest Compression Device (ACCD)

ACCD placement is indicated for pulseless patients where CPR is needed.

- If high quality CPR can be accomplished with a CPR feedback device, then placement of the ACCD can occur at any point in the management of cardiac arrest patients prior to their movement or transport

- Once providers initiate patient movement or transport, an ACCD is required since the ability to perform high quality manual compressions diminishes during this activity

- Patients can be managed with manual CPR on scene, as long as paramedics utilize a CPR feedback device to deliver and monitor high quality compressions with minimal interruptions

- If providers cannot perform manual high quality compressions with minimal interruptions, then the ACCD should be applied as soon as possible

---

### Position-Based CPR Response Plan

A **position-based CPR response plan** (e.g., Pit Crew CPR) will facilitate a coordinated effort in the management of cardiac arrest patients.

- Assigning personnel pre-determined positions and duties will support a focused and coordinated strategy maximizing the effectiveness of each EMS provider on scene

- Each ALS provider agency needs to implement this type of formal position-based CPR response plan, although some flexibility is appropriate based on which delivery model is selected

---

### Defibrillation Technique

High quality CPR should be performed while the defibrillator is charging with **immediate CPR resumption post defibrillation**.

Focus should be to **minimize the time off the chest during the defibrillation procedure** while providing for personnel safety.

A **"hovering" technique** is most widely used to accomplish minimal time off the chest before and after defibrillation.

---

### Alternative Airways

Unless **passive ventilation** is in use, alternate ALS airways (e.g., iGel, etc.) may be placed at any time during the management of a cardiac arrest patient as long as CPR is not interrupted.

**Endotracheal intubation** should be withheld until at least 10 minutes into the management of the cardiac arrest patient unless more urgent clinical indications are present (e.g., swelling, burns, etc.).

---

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Passive Ventilation Procedure

Use of the **passive ventilation procedure is indicated for any cardiopulmonary arrest that is witnessed by either bystanders or EMS personnel**.

Refer to **OCEMS PR-025, Passive Ventilation Procedure**, for further information.

---

### Fine Ventricular Fibrillation

Patients in a cardiac rhythm of **fine ventricular fibrillation** benefit from an additional 2 minutes of high quality CPR without interruption of continuous compressions.

Fine ventricular fibrillation does not have a high success rate for conversion with defibrillation, thus continuing high quality CPR without interruption of continuous compressions for an additional 2 minutes may allow for further coronary perfusion and presentation of a coarser ventricular fibrillation upon reassessment of the rhythm.

---

### ETCO2 Monitoring

Obtaining initial **ETCO2 values when utilizing a BVM** and then monitoring the values will provide additional information on patient perfusion status while performing high quality CPR.

---

### Implanted Devices

If the patient has an **implanted pacemaker or defibrillator/pacemaker**, place electrode pads to either side and not directly on top of the implanted device.

---

### Medication Patches

If the patient has a **medication patch in place on the chest area**, remove the patch and wipe the area clean before attaching an electrode pad.

---

### Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillators (LifeVest®)

If a patient is wearing a **LifeVest®**:

- Proceed with standard evaluation and treatment measures

- Initiate CPR unless the vest device is broadcasting "press the response buttons," "electrical shock possible, do not touch patient," or "bystanders do not interfere"

- Follow standard treatment as described in algorithms above, remove the LifeVest®, and monitor/treat the patient with the standard monitor-defibrillator

- **To remove the LifeVest®:** First pull out or disconnect the battery, then remove the garment from the patient; Take vest, modem, charger, and extra battery to the hospital

---

### Push-Dose Epinephrine

If **Base Hospital orders push-dose epinephrine for refractory hypotension**, refer to **ALS Procedure #230 (Push-Dose Epinephrine)** for technique in performing procedure.

---

### Epinephrine Supply Management

ALS providers should **maintain an adequate supply of epinephrine** to ensure enough supply is present to treat cardiac arrest patients according to this policy.

Should supplies become limited, consider **withholding further doses of epinephrine after 20 minutes of CPR**.

If consideration is being given to using expired epinephrine, **only administer a total of 3 doses during a cardiac arrest**.
