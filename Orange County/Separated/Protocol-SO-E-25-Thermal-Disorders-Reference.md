## Detailed Pathophysiology of Hypothermia

### Temperature-Dependent Physiologic Changes

#### Mild Hypothermia (32-35°C / 90-95°F)

**Cardiovascular:**
- Initial tachycardia (sympathetic response)
- Increased blood pressure (vasoconstriction)
- Then bradycardia develops
- Increased cardiac output initially

**Respiratory:**
- Tachypnea initially
- Increased minute ventilation

**Neurologic:**
- Confusion, poor judgment
- Ataxia (uncoordinated movement)
- Dysarthria (slurred speech)
- Apathy

**Metabolic:**
- Shivering (maximal at 35°C)
- Increased oxygen consumption
- Increased metabolic rate (trying to generate heat)

**Behavioral:**
- Poor decision-making
- "Paradoxical undressing" (feel hot, remove clothes)
- Impaired fine motor skills

---

#### Moderate Hypothermia (28-32°C / 82-90°F)

**Cardiovascular:**
- Progressive bradycardia
- Hypotension
- Decreased cardiac output
- Atrial fibrillation common
- Cardiac irritability increases
- J waves (Osborn waves) appear

**Respiratory:**
- Hypoventilation
- Decreased respiratory rate
- Decreased tidal volume

**Neurologic:**
- Stupor, confusion worsens
- Loss of shivering reflex (BAD SIGN)
- Decreased consciousness
- Dilated pupils
- Decreased reflexes

**Metabolic:**
- Decreased oxygen consumption (50% at 28°C)
- Decreased metabolic rate

**Renal:**
- "Cold diuresis" early
- Later: decreased urine output

---

#### Severe Hypothermia (<28°C / <82°F)

**Cardiovascular:**
- Severe bradycardia or asystole
- Ventricular fibrillation risk very high
- May appear to have no pulse
- Extreme cardiac irritability

**Respiratory:**
- Apnea or near-apnea
- Minimal chest rise
- May appear not breathing

**Neurologic:**
- Coma
- Areflexia (no reflexes)
- Fixed dilated pupils (may not mean death)
- Flaccid

**Muscular:**
- Rigidity (may mimic rigor mortis)
- No shivering

**Appearance:**
- May appear dead
- But potentially viable

---

### ECG Changes in Hypothermia

#### Osborn Waves (J Waves)

**Description:**
- Extra positive deflection at the end of QRS complex
- "Hump" or "camel hump" appearance
- Best seen in precordial leads (V2-V5)
- Also visible in limb leads

**Significance:**
- Pathognomonic for hypothermia
- Amplitude increases as temperature decreases
- Larger J wave = colder temperature
- Not specific for severity but confirms diagnosis

**Mechanism:**
- Due to altered depolarization/repolarization
- Differences in epicardial vs endocardial action potentials

---

#### Other ECG Findings

**PR Interval:**
- Prolonged

**QRS Duration:**
- Widened
- Bundle branch blocks may appear

**QT Interval:**
- Prolonged
- QTc markedly prolonged

**Rhythm:**
- **Sinus bradycardia** (most common early)
- **Atrial fibrillation** (very common, especially moderate hypothermia)
- **Junctional rhythm**
- **Idioventricular rhythm**
- **Ventricular fibrillation** (severe)
- **Asystole** (severe)

**Voltage:**
- May be decreased (due to thick chest wall if edematous, or poor conduction)

---

### Why Hypothermia Can Be Protective

**Decreased Metabolic Demand:**
- At 28°C: 50% decrease in O₂ consumption
- At 22°C: 75% decrease
- At 20°C: 80% decrease

**Neuroprotection:**
- Decreased cerebral metabolic rate
- Can tolerate longer periods of hypoxia
- Less ischemic brain injury

**Remarkable Survivals:**
- Documented survival after >6 hours of CPR
- Cold water drowning victims recovered neurologically intact
- Children especially resilient

**"Therapeutic Hypothermia":**
- Now called "targeted temperature management"
- Used post-cardiac arrest to improve neurologic outcomes
- Intentionally induced to 32-36°C
- Shows hypothermia protective for brain

**Teaching Points:**
- Alcohol common contributor (vasodilation + poor judgment)
- "Urban hypothermia" - doesn't need freezing weather
- Wet clothing critical to remove
- Shivering is good (still generating heat)
- Confusion will improve with rewarming
- Bradycardia treated by rewarming, not medications

### Scenario 2: Severe Hypothermia - Appears Dead But Has Pulse

**Dispatch:**
- "Person down, not moving"

**Scene:**
- Early morning
- Behind commercial building
- 68 y/o male lying on concrete

- Patient in wet clothing (rain overnight)

**Initial Impression:**
- **Appears dead**
- Not moving
- Not obviously breathing
- Skin cold, ashen
- Rigid
- Bystanders think deceased

**Assessment (MUST be thorough):**
1. **Scene safety confirmed**
2. **Approach patient carefully**
3. **Check responsiveness:**
   - No response to voice
   - No response to painful stimuli
4. **Open airway:**
   - Head tilt-chin lift
   - No gag reflex
5. **Check breathing (10 seconds):**
   - Very shallow, barely visible
   - About 4 breaths/minute
   - Inadequate
6. **⚠️ CRITICAL: EXTENDED PULSE CHECK**
   - "Checking pulse for full 30-45 seconds per hypothermia protocol"
   - Carotid pulse
   - **At 30 seconds: FAINT PULSE DETECTED**
   - Very weak, very slow
   - Continue counting for full 45 seconds
   - **Pulse definitely present** (approximately 28-30 BPM)

**THIS PATIENT HAS A PULSE - NOT CARDIAC ARREST**

**Physical:**
- Unresponsive (GCS 3)
- Pupils dilated, sluggish reaction
- Skin extremely cold, gray
- Rigid muscles
- Wet clothing
- No obvious trauma

**Cardiac Monitor (after moving to ambulance):**
- Severe bradycardia, ~28 BPM
- Wide QRS
- **Prominent J waves** (diagnostic)
- Atrial fibrillation underlying rhythm

**This is SEVERE hypothermia but NOT cardiac arrest**

**Management:**
1. **Patient has pulse → Do NOT do CPR**
   - Document extended pulse check
   - Pulse present after 30 seconds
2. **Breathing inadequate → Assist ventilation:**
   - BVM with high-flow oxygen
   - 100% FiO₂
   - Normal rate (12/min)
   - Avoid hyperventilation
   - Chest difficult to ventilate (rigid)
3. **Move to warm ambulance:**
   - **Handle extremely gently**
   - "This is like handling nitroglycerin"
   - Any rough movement can trigger VF
   - Lift carefully to stretcher
4. **Remove wet clothing:**
   - Cut off (don't pull over head)
   - Patient cannot assist
   - Minimize movement
5. **Active rewarming immediately:**
   - Heat packs:
     * Chest
     * Both axillae
     * Neck bilaterally
     * Groin
   - Multiple warm blankets
   - Space blanket over regular blankets
   - Cap on head
   - Ambulance heat on full
6. **Cardiac monitoring:**
   - Severe bradycardia (~28)
   - Atrial fib with wide QRS
   - J waves prominent
   - **Do NOT treat bradycardia**
   - Document on multiple strips
7. **IV access (if possible without rough handling):**
   - May be very difficult (vasoconstriction)
   - If able: large bore
   - Room temp or warm saline
   - Not critical - don't delay for this
8. **Continue assisted ventilation:**
   - BVM throughout transport
   - Monitor ETCO₂ if available
   - Maintaining adequate ventilation
9. **Reassessment q3 minutes:**
   - Still unresponsive
   - Pulse remains present (but weak)
   - Breathing still inadequate (continue BVM)
   - After 15 min: HR improved to 35
   - Slight muscle relaxation
10. **Alert hospital early:**
    - "Severe hypothermia"
    - "Patient appears dead but has pulse"
    - "Will need aggressive rewarming"
    - ETA
11. **Transport:**
    - Lights and sirens
    - Continue warming
    - Continue BVM
    - Gentle driving (dysrhythmia risk)

**Critical Decision:**
- **If pulse not checked for full 30-45 seconds:**
  - Would have assumed cardiac arrest
  - Would have started CPR
  - CPR on patient with pulse can trigger VF
  - Could kill patient
- **Extended pulse check saved this patient's life**

**Hospital Course (Likely):**
- Core temperature 25°C (77°F)
- Active core rewarming (heated  peritoneal lavage or ECMO)
- Continued ventilator support
- Rhythm converts to sinus as warms
- May require 6-12 hours to rewarm
- If neurologically intact: good outcome possible

**Teaching Points:**
- **Looks dead, isn't dead**
- **30-45 second pulse check is CRITICAL**
- Don't do CPR if pulse present (even if very slow)
- No medications for bradycardia (rewarming is treatment)
- Gentle handling cannot be overemphasized
- "Not dead until warm and dead"

- Fell on ice last night (~12 hours ago)
- Overnight low 28°F (-2°C)

**Initial Impression:**
- On ground next to front steps
- Conscious, confused
- Shivering
- Obvious leg deformity

**Assessment:**
- **A:** Patent
- **B:** RR 20, adequate, shivering
- **C:** HR 52, weak radial pulse
- **D:** Confused, knows name, doesn't know where she is
  - Complaining of severe right hip pain
  - Can move left leg, cannot move right
  - Both arms moving
  - No head injury visible
- **E:** Right hip/leg obvious deformity
  - Shortening and rotation of right leg

- J waves present

**History:**
- Fell on ice last night
- Tried to get up, couldn't
- Yelled for help, no one heard
- Lay outside all night (~12 hours)
- Temperature was below freezing
- Became confused
- Neighbor found her this morning

**Assessment:**
**Dual Problems:**
1. **Moderate hypothermia**
2. **Orthopedic trauma** (hip fracture/dislocation)

**Management (Must address both):**

**Hypothermia Management:**
1. Move to warm ambulance immediately
2. Remove damp clothing (cut around injured leg)
3. Active warming:
   - Heat packs (chest, axillae, neck, groin)
   - Warm blankets
   - Cover head
   - Ambulance heat
4. Cardiac monitoring (bradycardia present)
5. **Do NOT treat bradycardia** (expected)
6. Check blood glucose → 65 mg/dL (borderline)
   - Give oral glucose (patient can swallow)

**Trauma Management:**
1. Right hip/leg assessment:
   - Obvious deformity
   - Distal pulse present (weak but present)
   - Sensation diminished (but patient cold overall)
   - Cannot move toes
   - Hip fracture or posterior dislocation likely
2. Gentle immobilization:
   - Pad around leg as is
   - Don't try to reduce
   - Secure to backboard gently
   - Avoid movement
3. Pain management:
   - Fentanyl 50 mcg IV (patient cold but BP adequate)
   - Careful titration
4. Handle gently throughout:
   - Risk of dysrhythmia from hypothermia
   - Risk of worsening fracture
5. Full body exam (no other injuries found)

**Transport Decision:**
- Orthopedic trauma + hypothermia
- Base Hospital contact
- Determine: ERC vs Trauma Center?
- Base advises: ERC with orthopedic capability
- Hip can be managed after rewarming

**Transport:**
1. ALS escort
2. Continue warming
3. Monitor cardiac rhythm (dysrhythmia risk)
4. Serial assessments of injured leg
5. Pain management
6. Warming improving mental status

**Reassessment:**
- After 20 minutes warming:
  - More alert, knows where she is now
  - Still confused about time
  - HR improved to 62
  - Shivering decreased (warming up)
  - Hip still very painful but fentanyl helping

**Hospital Course (Likely):**
- Core temp 31°C (moderate hypothermia)
- Continued rewarming
- X-ray: posterior hip dislocation
- Once normothermic: closed reduction
- Admission for observation
- Social services (why outside alone?)
- Good outcome expected

**Teaching Points:**
- Trauma + hypothermia = complex
- Must address both problems
- Hypothermia can occur from immobilization (couldn't get inside)
- Elderly at high risk
- Handle gently (both for dysrhythmia risk and fracture)
- Confusion will improve with rewarming
- Pain management still appropriate (but careful dosing)
- Base Hospital helpful for destination determination

## Special Populations - Detailed

### Elderly Patients

**Increased Risk Factors:**
- Decreased metabolic rate (less heat production)
- Decreased shivering response (may not shiver even when cold)
- Decreased perception of cold (may not feel cold)
- Decreased mobility (can't move to warmer area)
- Multiple medications (affect thermoregulation)
- Chronic medical conditions
- Inadequate heating (can't afford, thermostat set low)
- Social isolation (no one checks on them)

**Can Develop "Indoor Hypothermia":**
- House temperature 55-60°F
- Patient thinks it's normal
- Gradual onset over days
- May not realize they're cold

**Orange County Considerations:**
- Mild winter temperatures
- People don't expect hypothermia risk
- Elderly may not heat homes adequately
- Homeless elderly population

**Assessment Challenges:**
- Baseline confusion (dementia)
- Difficult to assess mental status changes
- Multiple comorbidities
- Polypharmacy

**Management Considerations:**
- More aggressive rewarming may be needed
- Watch for complications (CHF, MI)
- Social services consult essential
- May need home safety evaluation

---

### Alcohol-Related Hypothermia

**Why Alcohol Increases Risk:**
- **Vasodilation** (feel warm, actually losing heat)
- **Impaired judgment** (don't seek shelter, remove clothing)
- **Decreased shivering** (central effect)
- **Hypoglycemia** (depletes glycogen stores)
- **Increased risk behaviors** (sleeping outside)
- **Decreased awareness** of being cold

**"Paradoxical Undressing":**
- Hypothermic patients remove clothing
- Feel hot due to peripheral vasodilation
- Actually losing core heat
- Found naked or partially clothed
- Often misinterpreted as assault/foul play

**Assessment Considerations:**
- Difficult to separate alcohol intoxication from hypothermia
- Both cause confusion, ataxia, slurred speech
- Both cause altered mental status
- Check glucose (alcohol depletes glycogen)
- Look for other injuries (falls, assault)

**Management:**
- Standard hypothermia management
- Check glucose, treat if low
- Don't assume all symptoms from alcohol
- May improve dramatically with rewarming and glucose
- Still need hospital evaluation

**Social Considerations:**
- Often homeless
- Recurrent problem
- Social services critical
- Substance abuse treatment
- Housing resources

---

### Homeless Population

**Highest Risk Group:**
- Chronic cold exposure
- Inadequate clothing/shelter
- Often intoxicated
- Mental illness common
- Resistant to seeking shelter
- Poor nutrition (decreased heat production)
- Chronic medical conditions

**Common Presentation:**
- Found outside
- Wet clothing (rain, sleeping on ground)
- Multiple episodes (frequent flyers)
- May refuse transport initially
- Combative when confused

**Management Challenges:**
- May be combative
- Poor historian
- Multiple medical problems
- Substance abuse
- Lice, scabies (universal precautions)
- Resistance to care

**Treatment Same:**
- Rewarm
- Transport
- Hospital evaluation
- Social services
- Compassionate care

---

## Prevention Education

### At-Risk Populations:

**Elderly:**
- Maintain home temperature >68°F
- Dress warmly indoors
- Eat adequate nutrition
- Check on elderly neighbors
- Social services if inadequate heating

**Homeless:**
- Shelter information
- Resources available
- Cold weather alerts

**Outdoor Enthusiasts:**
- Proper clothing (layers)
- Emergency supplies
- Know signs of hypothermia
- "Cotton kills" (wet cotton = hypothermia)
- Wool and synthetics better

**General:**
- Never ignore someone out in cold
- Check on neighbors during cold weather
- Bring pets indoors
- Emergency kits in vehicles (winter)

---

## Prognostic Factors

### Better Prognosis:

- **Young age** (especially children)
- **Cold water immersion** (protective)
- **Witnessed arrest** (if arrest occurs)
- **Short duration** of arrest before CPR
- **Good quality CPR** throughout
- **Hospital with ECMO** capability
- **Accidental hypothermia** (not medical cause)

### Worse Prognosis:

- **High serum potassium** (>12 mEq/L suggests prolonged arrest)
- **Severe trauma** as cause
- **Asphyxia** as primary event
- **Medical cause** of hypothermia (sepsis, etc.)
- **Prolonged warm cardiac arrest** before cooling
- **Fixed dilated pupils** in normothermic patient (but OK when cold)

### Documented Survivals:

- **Longest submersion:** >66 minutes (cold water)
- **Lowest temperature survived:** 13.7°C (56.7°F) - adult
- **Longest CPR:** >6 hours - neurologically intact
- Many cases of survival after >1 hour CPR

**Never give up too soon in hypothermia**

---

## Quality Assurance

### Metrics for Hypothermia Calls:

**Assessment:**
- Extended pulse check documented (30-45 sec)
- ECG obtained, J waves noted if present
- Core temperature obtained (if able)
- Glucose checked

**Management:**
- Wet clothing removed
- Active rewarming initiated
- Gentle handling documented
- Bradycardia NOT treated with atropine
- ACLS modifications followed (if cardiac arrest)
- CPR continued throughout transport (if arrest)
- Field pronouncement NOT made (if arrest)

**Common Errors:**
- Short pulse check (missed pulse)
- Treating bradycardia with atropine
- Normal ACLS dosing when <30°C
- Multiple defibrillations when <30°C
- Field pronouncement
- Rough handling
- Not removing wet clothing
- Inadequate rewarming
