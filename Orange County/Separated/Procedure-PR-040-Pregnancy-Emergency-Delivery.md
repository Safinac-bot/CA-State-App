## PROCEDURE:

### If Delivery is Imminent, the Following Should Be Done at the Scene or During Transport:

• Patients in labor should be placed in the left lateral decubitus position.

• ABCs/monitor cardiac rhythm.

• High flow oxygen by mask as tolerated.

• IV access, rate titrated to perfusion as needed.

• ALS escort. Do not delay transport for delivery of placenta.

• For postpartum bleed, externally massage uterine fundus after delivery of placenta.

---

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

### Presentation of Intact Amniotic Sac:

• Pinch and twist the sac near the baby's face to rupture; do not use sharp object, e.g., scissors. Remove the baby and proceed as indicated.

• ALS escort to PRC with OB capability.

---

### Nuchal Chord:

• If the umbilical cord is looped around the baby's neck, insert a finger below the cord and move it over the head to free the baby for delivery (sometimes the cord can be wrapped twice around the neck).

---

### Prolapsed Cord:

• Elevate mother's hips in left lateral position or consider Trendelenburg position.

• Insert gloved hand into the vagina and gently keep the presenting part off cord. Continue procedure until care of patient is assumed by hospital staff.

• ALS escort to PRC with OB capability.

---

### Breech Delivery:

If breech delivery occurs, assist as follows:

• Allow the mother to push; do not pull on extremity.

• Gently guide the newborn's arms down and out if necessary.

• Support the newborn about the chest; turn the back towards you, if possible, to prevent the chin from catching on the mother's pubic rim.

• If the head does not deliver in 4 - 6 minutes, attempt to free the head by placing 2 fingers in the vagina; gently push the chin against the chest to free or dislodge the head from the pubis.

• If the head does not deliver, insert hand into the vagina and gently keep the presenting part off the cord. Continue procedure until care of patient is assumed by hospital medical staff.

• ALS escort to PRC with OB capability.
