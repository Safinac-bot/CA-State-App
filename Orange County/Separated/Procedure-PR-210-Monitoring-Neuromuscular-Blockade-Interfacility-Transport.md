## PROCEDURE:

- Assure endotracheal tube is in good position and document (listen for bilateral breath sounds and no sounds over epigastrium)

- Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs.

- Constant observation and frequent re-assessment of airway.

- Assure constant ventilation.

- If endotracheal tube becomes dislodged, remove and support ventilation with BVM during remainder of transport.

- Avoid injury, i.e., correctly position patient and make sure patient's eyes are gently taped closed.

- Question transferring facility personnel prior to transport:
  - Will the neuromuscular blocking agent wear off before hospital arrival?
  - Is the patient sedated and pain free?

- If an adult requires additional sedation during transport and systolic BP greater than 90:

  **Adult/Adolescent (may give as standing order):**
  - → Midazolam 5 mg IV once

  **If a child (13 months to less than 15 years) requires additional sedation during transport, contact Base Hospital (if 911 transport) for further orders.**

- Document patient physical and mental status on arrival to destination and inform receiving staff if midazolam administered.
