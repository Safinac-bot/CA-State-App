## ALS STANDING ORDERS

**Allergic reactions may be mild to life threatening (termed anaphylaxis), treat based on the following assessment findings:**

---

## I. Allergic Reaction:

### Allergic reaction with only rash or urticaria, and with stable vital signs and no history of anaphylaxis:

**→ Pulse oximetry:** if room air oxygen saturation less than 95%, manage as anaphylaxis as described below.

**→ Transport to nearest appropriate ERC. ALS escort if history of anaphylaxis.**

---

### Allergic reaction limited only to facial/cervical angioedema:

**► Epinephrine 0.5 mg IM lateral thigh area (1 mg/1 mL concentration) – one time dose, HOLD if Epinephrine Auto-injector administered prior to arrival.**

**► Oxygen by mask (high flow) or nasal cannula (for nasal cannula provide 6 L/min flow rate) as tolerated.**

**► Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) 50 mg IM or IV once (do not administer if diphenhydramine taken prior to arrival).**

**→ ALS escort to nearest appropriate ERC.**

---

## II. Anaphylaxis:

**Anaphylactic reaction includes hypotension, wheezing, hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 95% saturation), stridor, intra-oral swelling, gastrointestinal symptoms, and/or impending airway obstruction:**

**► Epinephrine 0.5 mg IM lateral thigh (1 mg/1mL concentration). If Epinephrine Auto-injector administered prior to arrival, consider one dose of epinephrine has been provided.**

**► Oxygen by mask (high flow) or nasal cannula (provide 6 L/min flow rate) as tolerated.**

**→ Establish IV/IO access. If hypotensive:**

**► Normal Saline, infuse 250 mL IV or IO bolus, repeat up to maximum 1 liter to maintain adequate perfusion**

**→ If wheezing or hypoxic (initial room air pulse oximetry less than 95% saturation):**

**► Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated**

**→ After initial IM epinephrine given as above, if after 5 minutes symptoms of hypotension, respiratory distress, or impending airway obstruction continue, repeat**

**► Epinephrine 0.5 mg IM lateral thigh (1 mg/1 mL concentration) or**  
**OR**  
**Epinephrine 0.3 mg IV / IO (0.1 mg/1 mL concentration)**

**►Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) 50 mg IM/IV once (do not administer if diphenhydramine taken prior to arrival).**

**→ Contact Base Hospital and ALS escort to Base designated ERC.**

---

## Patients self-treated with Epi-Pen (epinephrine auto-injector) prior to EMS arrival:

**Consider patient having received first 0.5 mg epinephrine IM dose and otherwise follow above steps.**

**ALS escort to ERC for further evaluation even when symptoms resolving.**

---

## Understanding Anaphylaxis

**Anaphylaxis** is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that can progress rapidly and cause:
- Airway obstruction (swelling)
- Respiratory failure (bronchospasm)
- Cardiovascular collapse (distributive shock)
- Death if untreated

**Key Concept:** Anaphylaxis is a **clinical diagnosis** based on signs and symptoms, not requiring all criteria be present.

---

## Allergic Reaction vs Anaphylaxis

### Simple Allergic Reaction (Mild):

**Presentation:**
- Rash, hives (urticaria)
- Itching
- Stable vital signs
- No respiratory symptoms
- No cardiovascular symptoms

**Management:**
- Assess pulse oximetry
- If SpO₂ < 95% → treat as anaphylaxis
- Transport to ERC
- ALS escort if history of anaphylaxis

---

### Facial/Cervical Angioedema (Moderate):

**Angioedema** = swelling of deeper layers of skin/mucosa

**Presentation:**
- Swelling of face, lips, tongue
- Swelling of neck
- May progress to airway compromise
- Vital signs may be stable

**Management:**
- **Epinephrine 0.5 mg IM** (one dose)
- **Hold if** Epi-Pen already given
- High-flow oxygen
- Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM/IV
- ALS escort to ERC
- Monitor airway closely

**Why Epinephrine:**
- Prevents progression to airway obstruction
- Reduces swelling
- Time-sensitive

---

### Anaphylaxis (Severe):

**Definition:** Allergic reaction with ANY of these:

**Cardiovascular:**
- **Hypotension** (SBP < 90 or drop > 30% from baseline)
- Distributive shock

**Respiratory:**
- **Wheezing** (bronchospasm)
- **Hypoxia** (SpO₂ < 95%)
- **Stridor** (upper airway swelling)
- **Intra-oral swelling** (tongue, uvula, pharynx)
- **Impending airway obstruction**

**Gastrointestinal:**
- Severe abdominal pain
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea

**If ANY present:** Full anaphylaxis protocol

---

## Epinephrine: The Critical Medication

**Epinephrine is the ONLY medication that reverses anaphylaxis**
- Antihistamines (Benadryl) help symptoms but DON'T reverse anaphylaxis
- Albuterol helps wheezing but DON'T reverse anaphylaxis
- **Epinephrine is first-line and life-saving**

### IM Epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL concentration):

**Dose:** 0.5 mg IM  
**Location:** Lateral thigh (vastus lateralis)  
**Why IM:** Rapid absorption, safe, effective  
**Why thigh:** Best absorption, can give through clothing if needed

**Initial Dose:**
- 0.5 mg IM for all adult/adolescent patients
- One time dose initially

**Repeat Dose (if needed after 5 minutes):**
- If symptoms persist (hypotension, respiratory distress, airway obstruction)
- May give second 0.5 mg IM dose
- OR switch to IV epinephrine (see below)

**If Epi-Pen Given Before Arrival:**
- Consider one dose already given
- Don't give routine second dose
- But if symptoms severe/worsening, can give another

---

### IV Epinephrine (0.1 mg/1 mL concentration):

**Dose:** 0.3 mg IV/IO  
**When:** Second dose option if symptoms persist after 5 minutes  
**Concentration:** 0.1 mg/1 mL (diluted)  
**Route:** IV or IO

**Why Different Concentration:**
- IV epinephrine more potent
- Risk of overdose with IM concentration
- 0.1 mg/1 mL concentration = safer IV dosing

**Choose IV over IM if:**
- IV already established
- Severe, rapidly worsening symptoms
- Cardiovascular collapse

---

## Other Medications

### Oxygen:

**High-flow oxygen or nasal cannula (6 L/min)**
- All anaphylaxis patients
- All angioedema patients
- Goal: SpO₂ ≥ 95%

---

### Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®):

**Dose:** 50 mg IM or IV once  
**Hold if:** Patient took diphenhydramine before arrival

**Purpose:**
- Antihistamine
- Helps with itching, hives
- **Does NOT reverse anaphylaxis**
- Adjunct therapy only

**Why Only Once:**
- Long half-life
- Additional doses don't help acutely
- Can cause sedation

---

### Normal Saline:

**Indication:** Hypotension  
**Dose:** 250 mL bolus, repeat up to 1 liter total  
**Goal:** Maintain adequate perfusion

**Why Needed:**
- Anaphylaxis causes distributive shock
- Vasodilation → hypotension
- Capillary leak → fluid shifts
- Need volume resuscitation

---

### Albuterol:

**Indication:** Wheezing or hypoxic (SpO₂ < 95%)  
**Dose:** Continuous nebulization 6 mL (5 mg)

**Purpose:**
- Bronchodilator
- Opens airways
- Relieves bronchospasm
- Improves oxygenation

---

## Epi-Pen (Epinephrine Auto-Injector)

**If Patient Self-Administered Epi-Pen:**
- Consider as first 0.5 mg dose
- Don't routinely give second dose immediately
- Assess response
- If symptoms persist/worsen after 5 min → give additional epinephrine
- **Still transport ALS** even if improving
- Biphasic reactions can occur

**Two Types of Epi-Pens:**
- Adult (0.3 mg)
- Junior (0.15 mg for pediatrics)
- Most adults use adult strength

---

## Airway Management

**Monitor Airway Closely:**
- Angioedema can progress rapidly
- Intra-oral swelling can obstruct
- Stridor = partial obstruction (critical)

**Signs of Impending Obstruction:**
- Stridor
- Hoarse voice, difficulty speaking
- Drooling
- Tripod positioning
- Anxiety
- Increased work of breathing

**If Airway Compromised:**
- Give epinephrine immediately (don't wait)
- High-flow oxygen
- Prepare for advanced airway
- May need cricothyrotomy if complete obstruction
- Rapid transport

---

## Common Allergens

**Foods:**
- Peanuts, tree nuts
- Shellfish, fish
- Milk, eggs
- Wheat, soy

**Insect Stings:**
- Bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets
- Fire ants

**Medications:**
- Antibiotics (penicillin, cephalosporins)
- NSAIDs
- Aspirin
- ACE inhibitors (angioedema)

**Other:**
- Latex
- Contrast dye
- Exercise-induced
- Idiopathic (unknown)

---

## Assessment Priorities

### Initial Assessment:

**Airway:**
- Patent? Any swelling?
- Stridor? Hoarseness?
- Can speak in full sentences?

**Breathing:**
- Respiratory rate
- Work of breathing
- Wheezing?
- SpO₂

**Circulation:**
- Blood pressure (hypotension?)
- Heart rate
- Skin perfusion
- Capillary refill

**Skin:**
- Hives, rash, flushing
- Angioedema (swelling)

---

### History:

**Onset:**
- When did symptoms start?
- Rapid or gradual?

**Exposure:**
- New food, medication, sting?
- Known allergies?
- Previous anaphylaxis?

**Symptoms:**
- Itching, hives
- Swelling
- Breathing problems
- Dizziness, feeling faint
- GI symptoms

**Treatments:**
- Epi-Pen used?
- Antihistamines taken?
- Other medications?

---

## Biphasic Reactions

**Biphasic Reaction:** Second wave of anaphylaxis 4-12 hours after initial reaction

**Occurs in:** 5-20% of anaphylaxis cases

**Why It Matters:**
- Patient may improve in field
- Symptoms return hours later
- Can be severe
- **All anaphylaxis patients need hospital evaluation**
- **Never release patients who used Epi-Pen**

**This is why:** ALS escort to ERC even when symptoms resolving

---

## Key Points

✓ **Epinephrine is first-line** for anaphylaxis  
✓ **IM thigh** is preferred route (0.5 mg of 1:1000)  
✓ **Anaphylaxis = any of:** hypotension, wheezing, hypoxia, stridor, intra-oral swelling, GI symptoms  
✓ **Angioedema = epinephrine** even if stable (prevents progression)  
✓ **Simple rash only = check SpO₂**, transport ERC  
✓ **Repeat epinephrine after 5 min** if symptoms persist  
✓ **IV epinephrine** uses different concentration (0.1 mg/mL)  
✓ **Epi-Pen = first dose** already given  
✓ **Always ALS escort** if epinephrine given or history of anaphylaxis  
✓ **Biphasic reactions** = why everyone needs hospital eval  

---

## Common Errors

❌ **Delaying epinephrine** - give immediately  
❌ **Wrong concentration IV** - use 0.1 mg/mL for IV, not 1 mg/mL  
❌ **Only giving Benadryl** - doesn't reverse anaphylaxis  
❌ **Releasing Epi-Pen patients** - risk of biphasic reaction  
❌ **Not monitoring airway** in angioedema - can close rapidly  
❌ **Inadequate fluid resuscitation** - anaphylaxis causes severe vasodilation
