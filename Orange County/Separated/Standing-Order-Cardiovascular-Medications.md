## Aspirin

### Medication Information
**Generic Name:** Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)  
**Class:** Antiplatelet, Analgesic, Antipyretic

### Form
81 mg tab or 325 mg tab

### Route
PO (oral)

### Indication(s)
Chest pain of suspected cardiac origin

### Standing Order
Four 81 mg tabs (total 324 mg) or one 325 mg tab, swallowed or chewed, once

### Clinical Pearls
- Chewing provides faster absorption
- Most effective when given early in acute MI
- Non-enteric coated preferred for acute use
- Inhibits platelet aggregation
- Effects last for life of platelet (7-10 days)

### Contraindications
- Known aspirin allergy or hypersensitivity
- Active GI bleeding
- Severe bleeding disorder

### Precautions
- Use caution in patients with history of GI ulcers
- May increase bleeding risk
- Avoid in patients with known aspirin-induced asthma

## Atropine

### Medication Information
**Generic Name:** Atropine Sulfate  
**Class:** Anticholinergic, Parasympatholytic

### Formulations and Standing Orders

#### Formulation 1: For Bradycardia
**Form:** 1 mg single dose vial or prefill syringe  
**Route:** IV / IM  
**Indication:** Bradycardia, rate less than 60 and symptomatic (poor perfusion signs)  
**Standing Order:** 1 mg IV or IM, may repeat approximately every 3 minutes for continued symptomatic bradycardia to maximum of 3 mg

#### Formulation 2: For Organophosphate Poisoning
**Form:** 1 mg single dose vial or prefill syringe  
**Route:** IV / IM  
**Indication:** Organophosphate poisoning (including nerve agent) suspected  
**Standing Order:** 2 mg IV or IM, may repeat once

### Clinical Pearls
- Increases heart rate by blocking vagal tone
- More effective for symptomatic bradycardia than pacing in some cases
- May cause paradoxical bradycardia with doses < 0.5 mg
- In organophosphate poisoning, may require large doses
- Monitor for tachycardia and dysrhythmias

### Contraindications
- Tachycardia
- Acute angle-closure glaucoma
- Obstructive uropathy
- Known hypersensitivity to atropine

### Precautions
- Use caution in acute MI (increased oxygen demand)
- May cause urinary retention in elderly males
- Can cause pupillary dilation
- May worsen tachycardia in hyperthyroidism

#### Formulation 2: Sublingual Tablet (High BP)
**Form:** 0.4 mg tablet or powder packet  
**Route:** SL (sublingual)  
**Indication:** Pulmonary rales/suspected CHF, systolic BP greater than 150
