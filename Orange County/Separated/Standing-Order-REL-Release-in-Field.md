## VI. SPECIAL SITUATIONS

### Minor Injury/First Aid Provided

**Scenario:** Minor wound, band-aid applied, no further treatment needed
- **Use SO-REL** if patient stable and no further care indicated
- Document first aid provided
- Educate about signs/symptoms requiring further care
- Can release if all criteria met

### Well-Being Check/No Patient Contact

**Scenario:** 9-1-1 called but patient not on scene or refuses to be seen
- Not technically a "release"
- Document thorough scene assessment
- Document attempts to contact patient
- Consider law enforcement if safety concerns

### Accidental 9-1-1 Call

**Scenario:** Pocket dial, child playing with phone, accidental activation
- If patient can be identified and assessed: use SO-REL
- If no patient identified: document no patient found
- Complete scene assessment for safety

### Lift Assists (No Injury)

**Scenario:** Patient fell, needs help getting up, no injury
- Assess thoroughly (primary and secondary)
- Check vital signs
- If no injury/illness: can use SO-REL
- Educate about fall risks and when to seek care

### Frequent Callers (Non-Emergency)

**Scenario:** Patient calls 9-1-1 frequently for non-emergencies
- Each call requires complete assessment
- Use SO-REL if criteria met
- Consider social services referral
- Document patterns but assess each call independently

### School Nurse Assessments

**Scenario:** School nurse evaluated student, requests EMS check
- Complete independent assessment
- Can release to school staff if criteria met
- School staff can serve as "responsible adult"
- Ensure parent/guardian contacted

---

## VII. WHEN RELEASE IS NOT APPROPRIATE

### Do NOT Use SO-REL If:

1. **Any treatment or intervention was provided**
   - Medications given
   - IV started
   - Oxygen administered
   - Any procedure performed

2. **Medical or psychiatric emergency exists**
   - Even if minor complaints
   - Even if patient minimizes symptoms
   - Even if patient wants to stay

3. **Patient lacks capacity**
   - Altered mental status
   - Intoxication
   - Psychiatric impairment
   - Head injury with confusion

4. **Unsafe environment**
   - Domestic violence
   - Abuse suspected
   - Dangerous scene
   - No supervision for minor

5. **Patient or family requests transport**
   - Even if assessment normal
   - Patient's preference when in doubt

6. **Concerning vital signs or exam findings**
   - Abnormal vital signs
   - Focal neurologic findings
   - Signs of serious illness/injury
   - Progressive symptoms

7. **High-risk mechanisms or complaints**
   - Chest pain (any)
   - Head injury (any)
   - Syncope
   - Significant trauma mechanism

## VIII. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POLICIES

### SO-REL vs. SO-AMA

| Situation | Use SO-REL | Use SO-AMA |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| No medical emergency, EMS and patient agree no transport needed | ✓ | |
| Medical emergency exists, patient refuses care | | ✓ |
| Assessment normal, patient doesn't want transport | ✓ | |
| Assessment concerning, patient refuses transport | | ✓ |
| Signature required? | No | Yes |
| Base Hospital contact may be needed? | No | Yes (if capacity questioned) |

### When Both Could Apply

If **any doubt** exists about whether transport is indicated:
- Use **SO-AMA** rather than SO-REL
- More documentation required
- Provides better legal protection
- Err on side of caution

---

## IX. LEGAL AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

### Provider Protection

**Best practices for release in field:**
1. **Thorough assessment** - never cut corners
2. **Complete documentation** - describe all criteria met
3. **Clear communication** - ensure understanding
4. **Scene safety** - never leave patient in danger
5. **When in doubt** - transport or use SO-AMA

### Liability Considerations

- Releasing patients carries inherent risk
- Documentation is critical for legal protection
- Must meet ALL criteria before release
- Any concerning finding = transport or SO-AMA
- Never release to avoid transport time

### Revisit and Reassessment

If EMS called back to same patient:
- Complete new assessment
- Previous release does not influence current call
- Each 9-1-1 call is independent event
- May need transport on subsequent call

---

## X. PATIENT EDUCATION POINTS

### What to Tell Patients/Parents Being Released:

1. **Assessment findings:**
   - "Based on our examination, we don't find any medical emergency"

2. **Follow-up care:**
   - "You can seek care from your doctor if symptoms develop or worsen"

3. **When to call 9-1-1 again:**
   - "Call 9-1-1 if [specific symptoms] develop"

4. **Red flag symptoms:**
   - Provide specific warning signs based on complaint

5. **Clarify expectations:**
   - "We won't be transporting you today, but you're welcome to call 9-1-1 anytime if you need us"
