## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Delivery Environment

**If possible, deliver infant in a warm, draft-free area.**

---

### 2. Minimize Heat Loss

**Minimize heat loss: dry face, head, and body. Do not allow wet linen to remain in contact with child. Wrap infant in dry blanket or towel.**

---

### 3. Positioning

**Position infant on back or on side with neck in a neutral position. If copious secretions are present, place on side with the neck slightly extended to allow secretions to collect in the mouth rather than the posterior pharynx.**

---

### 4. Airway and Oxygen

**Assure airway is open; provide oxygen by blow-by technique until child is active and crying.**

---

### 5. Apgar Score

**Perform Apgar Score at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth (see Guidelines below).**

---

### 6. Umbilical Cord

**If possible, clamp and cut cord (see OCEMS Procedure B-060).**

---

### 7. Base Hospital Contact

**Contact Base Hospital (CCERC base preferred) for appropriate destination with neonatal care capability.**

---

### 8. Transport

**ALS escort with mother.**

---

## NEWBORN IN DISTRESS

### If in Respiratory Distress:

**A. Assure airway is open and clear of secretions.**

**B. Administer oxygen by blow-by technique.**

**C. Stimulate by rubbing along the spine or slap feet.**

**D. Reposition to ensure open airway.**

**E. For respiratory depression due to suspected maternal use of narcotics and unresponsive to stimulation:**

**► Naloxone 0.1 mg/kg IN/IM once to a maximum of 1 mg.**

**F. Contact Base Hospital (CCERC base preferred) for appropriate destination with neonatal care capability.**

---

### Gasping Respirations / Apnea / HR<100/minute / Persistent Cyanosis:

**A. Assisted positive pressure ventilation with appropriately sized bag-valve-mask, rate 40-60 breaths/minute with room air. Provide oxygen if no improvement in 5 minutes.**

**B. Contact Base Hospital (CCERC base preferred) for appropriate destination with neonatal care capability.**

---

### Heart Rate < 60/minute / No Response to Above Measures:

**A. Begin chest compressions; interpose chest compressions with ventilations in a 3:1 ratio (90 compressions and 30 breaths per minute)**

**B. Contact Base Hospital (CCERC base preferred) for appropriate destination with neonatal care capability.**

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

• Drying usually produces enough stimulation to initiate effective respirations in most newborns.

• To determine heart rate: auscultate, do not attempt to palpate.

---

## Apgar Score

The Apgar Score measures newborn's status.

Each of the five categories are scored from 0-2 and then totaled. Apgar scoring is done twice; 1 minute after birth and 5 minutes after birth.

Resuscitation, if needed, should not await Apgar scoring.

| Scoring | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---------|---|---|---|
| **Heart rate** | Absent | Slow (below 100) | > 100 |
| **Respiratory Effort** | Absent | Weak Cry; Hypoventilation | Strong Cry |
| **Muscle Tone** | Limp | Slight Flexion of Extremities | Active Flexion |
| **Reflex irritability*** | No response | Some Grimace | Cough, sneeze, cry, withdrawal |
| **Color** | Blue, pale | Body pink, Extremities blue | Completely pink |

---

### Total Score Indications:

**One (1) minute Apgar Score indications:**
- 7-10 - a healthy infant.
- 4-6 - a potentially sick infant.
- 0-3 - a severely depressed infant.

**Five (5) minute Apgar Score indications:**
- 7-10 - a healthy infant.
- 4-6 - a potentially sick infant.
- 0-3 - a severely depressed infant.

**\* Test for reflex irritability by using a mild pinch to the abdomen or slapping the feet.**
