## ALS STANDING ORDERS:

### 1. For Any Burn Injury Occurring in an Enclosed Space or with Smoke Generated at the Site:

**► High-flow Oxygen by mask or nasal cannula (direct or blow-by) as tolerated** (pulse oximetry may be inaccurate with smoke inhalation).

---

### 2. Apply Cooling Measures if Burn Still Symptomatic.

---

### 3. For Wheezing or Suspected Smoke Inhalation:

**►Albuterol, Continuous nebulization of 6 mL (5 mg) concentration as tolerated.**

---

### 4. For Pain, Systolic BP > 80, Base Contact Required (CCERC Base Preferred) if ≤ 2 Years of Age

**(Do not inject medication or establish IV/IO through burned skin areas):**

**►Morphine sulfate: 0.1 mg/ kg IV/IM (maximum single dose of 5 mg), may repeat once after 3 minutes for continued pain (do not exceed total combined administration of 10 mg).**

**OR,**

**► Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg IN/IV/IM (maximum single dose of 50 mcg), may repeat once after 3 minutes for continued pain (do not exceed total combined administration of 100 mcg)**

---

### 5. For Blood Pressure ≤ 80 or Signs of Shock:

**►Establish IV/IO access in non-burned skin area**

**►Infuse normal saline 20 mL/kg IV/IO bolus (maximum 250 mL) and make BH contact (CCERC preferred). May repeat twice for total of 3 boluses as a standing order.**

---

### 6. Contact Base Hospital with CCERC Pediatric Base Preferred for Burn Unit Destination if Any of the Following Burn Criteria Are Met:

**Mechanism of Injury:**

- Suspected inhalation injury (patients burned in an enclosed space, patients with facial burns, hoarseness, dyspnea, soot in mouth, carbonaceous sputum, singed nasal hairs).
- Electric burns (including lightning injury).
- Chemical burns (including acids and bases).

**Physiological alteration:**

- Burns that involve the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or are circumferential.
- Patients with a pre-existing medical condition that may complicate management or prolong recovery (e.g. diabetes, renal failure, cardiac or pulmonary disease).

**Total Burn Surface Area (TBSA):**

- Second degree burns >10% total body surface area (TBSA).
- Any third degree burn.

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES:

### Suspected Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

**(Closed space burn, smoke inhalation, chemical fires):**

Pulse oximetry O2 saturation will be inaccurate due to inability of pulse oximeter to differentiate between carbon monoxide and oxygen molecule.

---

### Chemical Burns:

- Brush away any remaining dry chemical.
- Irrigate burn wound and surrounding skin with copious and continuous water or saline flush to dilute and remove as much residual chemical as possible.
  - **NOTE:** Some chemicals are activated by water / fluids and might worsen the burn or create hazardous fumes; e.g., sodium, phosphorus, acetyl bromide, aluminum carbide, silicon tetrachloride.

---

### Electrical Burns:

- Electrical burns may often appear insignificant while causing marked muscle and soft tissue damage.
- Cardiac irritability may occur with electrical burns. Any burn from high voltage, defined as equal to or greater than 500-1000 volts alternating current in a pediatric burn victim, should be transported with ALS escort and cardiac rhythm monitoring as tolerated by the child.
