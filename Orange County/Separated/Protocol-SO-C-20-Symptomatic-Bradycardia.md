## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. Cardiac Monitoring

**Monitor cardiac rhythm and document with rhythm strip.**

---

### 2. Oxygen Therapy

**Pulse oximetry**; if room air oxygen saturation less than 95%:

**► Administer High-flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow rate as tolerated.**

---

### 3. Vascular Access

**Establish IV access.** Consider IO if attempts at IV access are unsuccessful or not feasible.

---

### 4. Asymptomatic Bradycardia (Without Poor Perfusion)

If patient **without evidence of poor perfusion** or other symptoms (see Guidelines below):

**► Obtain 12-lead ECG**; if "Acute MI" indicated or a STEMI is suspected based on paramedic interpretation of 12-lead ECG, make Base Hospital contact for CVRC destination with an open cardiac catheterization lab.

---

### 5. Symptomatic Bradycardia Treatment

If **symptomatic bradycardia** (see Guidelines below):

**► Atropine: 1 mg IV/IO/IM approximately every 3-5 minutes as needed to correct bradycardia to a maximum total dose of 3 mg.**

---

### 6. Transcutaneous Pacing

If unable to attain IV/IO access or 1 mg Atropine fails to improve heart rate, continue Atropine dosing and:

**Place transcutaneous pacemaker and initiate pacing** (see Procedure Guideline # PR-110).

#### 6a. If Successfully Paced by Pacemaker

**→ Stop atropine dosing** and **contact Base Hospital** for potential CVRC destination.

#### 6b. If Paced with Hypotension (SBP < 90 and lungs clear)

**→ Contact Base Hospital** for potential CVRC destination and:

**☑ Administer normal saline, 250 mL IV/IO, repeat up to maximum 1 liter to maintain adequate perfusion**

#### 6c. If Pacing Causes Anxiety/Discomfort (SBP > 90)

**→ If transcutaneous pacing causes anxiety and extreme discomfort** and blood pressure greater than 90 systolic:

**► Administer midazolam (Versed®) up to 5 mg IV slowly titrated to attain sedation**  
(Assist ventilation and maintain airway if respiratory depression develops)

#### 6d. If No IV Access Available (SBP > 90)

**→ If IV access cannot be established** and blood pressure greater than 90 systolic:

**► Administer midazolam (Versed®) 5 mg IN divided between each nostril, may repeat once after approximately 3 minutes**  
(Assist ventilation and maintain airway if respiratory depression develops)

---

### 7. Hypotension Management

For **systolic blood pressure less than 90** (paced or if non-capture), no response to atropine, and lungs clear to auscultation:

**Administer normal saline, 250 mL, may repeat 3 times (total 1 liter) to maintain perfusion.**

**If BP < 90 after 1 liter of NS or if evidence of CHF, contact Base Hospital.**

---

### 8. Transport and Base Hospital Contact

**ALS escort with Base Hospital contact for CVRC destination.**

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### Definition of Symptomatic Bradycardia

**Symptomatic bradycardia is defined as:**

**Heart rate ≤ 60 bpm** AND **at least one** of the following:

- **Hypotension**
- **Signs of poor perfusion** (poor skin signs)
- **Altered level of consciousness**
- **Chest pain**
- **Shortness of breath, signs of pulmonary edema**

---

### Implanted Pacemaker Malfunction

If patient has an **implanted pacemaker** and is bradycardic with heart rate less than 60 bpm, treat in same manner as described in ALS Standing Orders above.

**Key Points:**
- Pacemaker may be malfunctioning
- Patient still needs treatment for symptomatic bradycardia
- Follow same algorithm
- Document pacemaker presence

---

### Cardiac Pacing Priority

**Cardiac pacing**, when immediately required to stabilize a patient, should be **deployed without waiting** if there is a delay in establishing IV/IO access.

**When to Pace Immediately:**
- Severe symptomatic bradycardia
- Deteriorating patient
- Poor perfusion despite atropine
- Cannot establish IV/IO access quickly

---

### Toxicologic and Metabolic Causes

Consider common **toxicologic and metabolic causes** of bradycardia:

- **Hyperkalemia**
- **Calcium-channel blockers**
- **Beta-blockers**
- **Digoxin**
- **Organophosphates**
- **Hypothermia**

**Contact Base Hospital** for additional medical direction if these suspected.

---

### 12-Lead ECG Interpretation for Acute MI

Consider an **acute MI is present** for the following 12-lead monitor interpretations:

1. **\*\*\*ACUTE MI\*\*\***
2. **\*\*\*STEMI\*\*\***
3. **Acute ST Elevation Infarct**
4. **Probable Acute ST Elevation Infarct**
5. **Acute Infarction**
6. **Infarct, Probably Acute**
7. **Infarct, Possible Acute**

---

### Push-Dose Epinephrine

**Base Hospital may order push-dose epinephrine** for refractory hypotension, refer to **ALS procedure # 230 (Push-Dose Epinephrine)**.

---

## Medication Details

### Atropine
**Dose:** 1 mg  
**Route:** IV/IO/IM  
**Frequency:** Every 3-5 minutes  
**Maximum Total:** 3 mg  
**Action:** Blocks vagal tone, increases heart rate  
**Onset:** 1-2 minutes  

**Key Points:**
- First-line medication for symptomatic bradycardia
- May be less effective in heart transplant patients
- Can paradoxically worsen bradycardia if given too slowly
- Continue while preparing for pacing if needed

---

### Midazolam (Versed®)

#### For Transcutaneous Pacing Discomfort

**IV Route:**
- **Dose:** Up to 5 mg IV
- **Administration:** Slowly titrated to attain sedation
- **Requirement:** Blood pressure > 90 systolic

**Intranasal (IN) Route:**
- **Dose:** 5 mg IN divided between each nostril
- **Repeat:** May repeat once after ~3 minutes
- **Use:** When IV access cannot be established
- **Requirement:** Blood pressure > 90 systolic

**Critical Safety:**
- Assist ventilation and maintain airway if respiratory depression develops
- Monitor continuously
- Have reversal agent (Flumazenil) available
- Titrate carefully to avoid oversedation

---

### Normal Saline Fluid Resuscitation

**Initial Bolus:** 250 mL IV/IO  
**Maximum:** May repeat up to 1 liter total  
**Goal:** Maintain adequate perfusion  
**Hold if:** Evidence of CHF (pulmonary edema)

**Indications:**
- Paced with BP < 90 systolic
- Non-capture with BP < 90 systolic
- Poor perfusion despite other interventions
- Lungs must be clear to auscultation

**Base Hospital Contact Required:**
- If BP < 90 after 1 liter NS
- If evidence of CHF develops

---

## Clinical Decision Support

### Assessment of Symptomatic vs. Asymptomatic

#### Symptomatic Bradycardia (TREAT):
- HR ≤ 60 **AND**:
  - Hypotension (SBP < 90)
  - Altered mental status
  - Chest pain/discomfort
  - Shortness of breath
  - Pulmonary edema
  - Cool, clammy skin
  - Decreased capillary refill

#### Asymptomatic Bradycardia (MONITOR):
- HR ≤ 60 but:
  - Normal blood pressure
  - Alert and oriented
  - No chest pain
  - No respiratory distress
  - Good perfusion
  - May be normal for patient (athlete)

---

### When to Consider STEMI/MI

**Bradycardia can be sign of inferior MI:**
- Right coronary artery occlusion
- AV nodal ischemia
- Vagal stimulation from inferior wall

**High Suspicion for MI if:**
- Bradycardia with chest pain
- New-onset bradycardia
- Associated hypotension
- Diaphoresis
- Nausea/vomiting

**Action:**
- Obtain 12-lead ECG early
- Look for inferior ST elevations (II, III, aVF)
- Consider right-sided leads
- Base Hospital contact for CVRC if STEMI

---

### Transcutaneous Pacing Considerations

#### When to Initiate Pacing:
- Atropine ineffective or contraindicated
- Severe symptomatic bradycardia
- High-degree AV blocks
- Bradycardia with poor perfusion

#### Pacing Technique (see PR-110):
1. Apply pacing pads (anterior-posterior preferred)
2. Set rate (usually 60-80 bpm)
3. Set output at 0 mA
4. Increase output until capture achieved
5. Confirm mechanical capture (pulse)
6. Set output 2 mA above capture threshold

#### Confirm Capture:
- **Electrical capture:** Pacer spike followed by wide QRS
- **Mechanical capture:** Palpable pulse with each QRS
- **Must confirm both** - electrical capture without mechanical ineffective

#### Managing Pacing Discomfort:
- Explain procedure to patient
- Consider sedation (midazolam) if BP allows
- Monitor for respiratory depression
- Reassess need for pacing as patient improves

## Causes of Bradycardia (Remember: "DIRECTED")

**D** - **Drugs** (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin)  
**I** - **Ischemia/Infarction** (especially inferior MI)  
**R** - **Reflex** (vagal stimulation)  
**E** - **Electrolytes** (hyperkalemia)  
**C** - **Cardiac** (sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks)  
**T** - **Temperature** (hypothermia)  
**E** - **Elevated ICP** (Cushing's triad)  
**D** - **Degenerative** (aging, fibrosis)

---

✓ **Sedate for pacing** if BP allows (midazolam up to 5 mg)  
✓ **Fluids for hypotension** - if lungs clear (250 mL boluses)  
✓ **Base Hospital required** for pacing with capture  
✓ **Consider causes** - drugs, MI, electrolytes, hypothermia  
✓ **Push-dose epi** available for refractory hypotension (Base order)
