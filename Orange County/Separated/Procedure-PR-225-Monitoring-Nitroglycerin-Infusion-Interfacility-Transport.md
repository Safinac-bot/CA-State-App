## INDICATION:

Nitroglycerin is drug that dilates arteries and veins; it is most commonly used to manage patients with acute coronary syndromes or myocardial infarction (by dilating coronary arteries). Nitroglycerin lowers blood pressure resistance to the outflow of blood being pumped by the heart and because of this property is used to stabilize patients with severe congestive heart failure. As a vasodilator, a risk of nitroglycerin is loss of blood pressure resulting in decrease perfusion of vital organs.

## PROCEDURE:

• Assure vascular access is stable and secure.

• Assure infusion pump is in working order and available for use during transport.

• Monitor and document cardiac rhythm and vital signs.

• Question appropriate transferring facility personnel (RN or MD) prior to transport:
  - What is the prescribed nitroglycerin infusion rate?
  - Has the patient had any known problems maintaining blood pressure?

• Obtain pertinent copies of the medical records.

• Set-up transfer infusion pump at the rate of infusion indicated as prescribed by the sending facility personnel (RN or MD).

• Initiate transport and maintain infusion rate prescribed by sending facility staff.

• Observe patient vital signs and monitored cardiac rhythm on a continuous basis.

• Observe patient for decreases in blood pressure, if blood pressure decreases below 90 systolic, or obvious signs of poor perfusion develop, discontinue infusion and transport to the nearest appropriate ERC.

• Document vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and patient condition when transferred to care of receiving facility.
