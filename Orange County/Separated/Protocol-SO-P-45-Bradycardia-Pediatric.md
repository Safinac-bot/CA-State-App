## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### A. If Signs of Cardiopulmonary Compromise Present

**Assess for signs of cardiopulmonary compromise (altered mental status, signs of shock, hypotension). If present:**

---

#### 1. Airway and Breathing

**Assure airway is open and without foreign body obstruction.**

**► Assist breathing, if necessary, with high flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula 6 L/min flow rate (direct or blow-by) as tolerated or positive pressure ventilation with BVM.**

---

#### 2. Monitoring

**Monitor cardiac rhythm and document with rhythm strip; monitor pulse, BP, and oximetry.**

---

#### 3. CPR and Medications

**If pulse rate remains less than 60/minute with continued signs of poor perfusion despite oxygenation/ventilation, initiate CPR.**

**Establish IV or IO access**

**Administer Epinephrine: 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO (0.1 mL/kg of the 0.1 mg/mL concentration). May repeat Epinephrine every 3-5 minutes.**

**Make Base Hospital contact (CCERC base preferred).**

**If unable to make Base Hospital contact, give Atropine 0.02 mg/kg IV/IO for persist bradycardia with symptoms, increased vagal tone, or primary AV block. Minimum dose 0.1 mg, maximum single dose 0.5 mg. May repeat once.**

**If continued signs of poor perfusion, obtain Base Hospital order for transcutaneous pacing using appropriately sized pads with preferred anterior-posterior placement unless child is adult size (refer to Procedure #PR-110).**

---

#### 4. Fluid Resuscitation

**If signs of hypovolemia or dehydration suspected, administer 20 mL/kg normal saline (maximum 250 ml) IV/IO bolus. May repeat twice for a total of 3 boluses as a standing order.**

---

#### 5. Identify and Treat Underlying Causes

**Identify and treat underlying causes (hypothermia, hypoxia, medications).**

---

### B. If No Signs of Cardiopulmonary Compromise

#### 1. ABCs

**Support airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).**

---

#### 2. Oxygen Therapy

**Give oxygen with high flow by mask or nasal cannula 6 L/min flow rate (direct or blow-by) as tolerated if O₂ saturation less than 95% on room air.**

---

#### 3. 12-Lead ECG

**Obtain 12-Lead ECG**

---

#### 4. Identify and Treat Underlying Causes

**Identify and treat underlying causes (hypothermia, hypoxia, medications).**

---

#### 5. Transport

**Contact Base Hospital (CCERC base preferred) for destination and transport with ALS escort.**
