## Detailed Burn Depth Classification

### First Degree Burns (Superficial)

**Layers Involved:**
- Epidermis only

**Appearance:**
- Red (erythema)
- No blisters
- Dry

**Pain:**
- Painful to touch
- Burning sensation

**Healing:**
- 3-6 days
- No scarring
- Peels like sunburn

**Example:**
- Sunburn
- Brief contact with hot object

**Treatment:**
- Usually outpatient
- Cooling
- Moisturizer, aloe
- Over-the-counter pain meds
- Not typically transported unless extensive

---

### Second Degree Burns (Partial Thickness)

**Two Subtypes:**

#### Superficial Partial Thickness

**Layers Involved:**
- Epidermis + superficial (papillary) dermis

**Appearance:**
- Bright red or pink
- Blisters (fluid-filled)
- Moist, weeping
- Blanches with pressure

**Pain:**

- Most painful burn type

**Healing:**
- 2-3 weeks
- Minimal scarring
- Usually no grafting needed

---

#### Deep Partial Thickness

**Layers Involved:**
- Epidermis + deep (reticular) dermis

**Appearance:**
- Red, white, or mottled
- May have blisters or dry surface
- Waxy appearance
- May not blanch with pressure

**Pain:**

---

## Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) Estimation

### Rule of Nines - Detailed

**Adult (>14 years):**
- **Head:** 9% (4.5% anterior, 4.5% posterior)
- **Neck:** Included in head 9%
- **Each Arm:** 9% total
  - Upper arm: 4.5%
  - Forearm: 4.5%
- **Anterior Trunk:** 18%
  - Chest: 9%
  - Abdomen: 9%
- **Posterior Trunk:** 18%
  - Upper back: 9%
  - Lower back: 9%
- **Each Leg:** 18% total
  - Anterior thigh: 4.5%
  - Posterior thigh: 4.5%
  - Anterior lower leg: 4.5%
  - Posterior lower leg: 4.5%
- **Genitalia/Perineum:** 1%

**TOTAL = 100%**

---

### Lund-Browder Chart (More Accurate)

Adjusts for age-related body proportion changes. More accurate than Rule of Nines, especially for children. Most burn centers use this.

**Age-Adjusted Areas:**
- Infant head larger proportionally
- Legs smaller proportionally in infants
- Adjusts through growth stages

**Use in Field:**
- Usually not practical
- Rule of Nines sufficient for initial assessment
- Hospital will use Lund-Browder for precise calculation

---

### Palm Method

**Patient's palm = 1% TBSA**
- Includes fingers
- More accurate: just palm (no fingers) = 0.5%

**When to Use:**
- Irregular burn patterns
- Scattered burns
- Quick estimation

**Example:**
- "Burn on leg is about 3 palm-widths = ~3% TBSA"

**Less Accurate but Fast**

---

### Common TBSA Examples

**Small Burns:**
- Entire hand (front and back) = ~2-3%
- One arm, anterior only = 4.5%
- One foot = ~3%

**Moderate Burns:**
- Entire anterior chest = 9%
- One entire leg = 18%
- Both arms = 18%

**Large Burns:**
- Entire anterior torso + both arms = 36%
- Both legs = 36%
- "Front" of body = ~45%

---

## Parkland Formula (For Information)

**Hospital will calculate fluid needs:**

**Formula:** 4 mL × % TBSA × weight (kg)

**Example:** 70 kg patient with 30% TBSA:
- 4 × 30 × 70 = 8,400 mL in first 24 hours
- Give half in first 8 hours
- Give second half over next 16 hours

**Prehospital Implications:**
- Large burns need MASSIVE fluids
- Field 1 liter is just beginning
- Don't delay transport for extensive fluid resuscitation
- Hospital will continue aggressive fluids

---

## Inhalation Injury - Detailed Assessment

### Three Types of Inhalation Injury

#### 1. Supraglottic (Upper Airway) Injury

**Location:** Above vocal cords
- Oropharynx, larynx

**Mechanism:**
- Direct thermal injury
- Hot gases/steam

**Presentation:**
- Stridor
- Hoarseness
- Difficulty swallowing
- Facial/oral burns
- Singed nasal hairs

**Danger:**
- Rapid airway swelling
- Complete obstruction possible
- "Window" for intubation closes quickly

**Management:**
- Early intubation before swelling
- Don't wait for stridor
- Difficult airway anticipated

---

#### 2. Infraglottic (Lower Airway) Injury

**Location:** Below vocal cords
- Trachea, bronchi

**Mechanism:**
- Inhalation of particulates
- Toxic chemicals
- Irritant gases

**Presentation:**
- Wheezing
- Cough
- Dyspnea
- Carbonaceous sputum
- May not have upper airway signs

**Complications:**
- Bronchospasm
- Mucosal sloughing
- Airway obstruction (delayed)
- Pneumonia

**Management:**
- Albuterol
- Oxygen
- May need intubation (later)
- Bronchoscopy at hospital

---

#### 3. Systemic Toxicity

**Mechanism:**
- Carbon monoxide (CO)
- Cyanide (burning synthetics)
- Other toxic gases

**Presentation:**
- Altered mental status
- Headache
- Nausea
- Cherry-red skin (CO - late sign)
- Lactic acidosis (cyanide)

**Management:**
- High-flow oxygen (CO)
- Cyanide antidote kit (if available and suspected)
- Supportive care

---

### Predictors of Severe Inhalation Injury

**High Risk if:**
- Enclosed space fire
- Loss of consciousness at scene
- Explosion
- Facial burns
- Carbonaceous sputum
- Hoarseness
- Stridor
- Respiratory distress

**Moderate Risk if:**
- Open space fire with prolonged exposure
- Chemical fire
- Soot in nose/mouth
- Cough

---

### Airway Management Considerations

**When to Intubate:**
- Stridor
- Severe hoarseness
- Inability to handle secretions
- Respiratory distress
- Altered mental status
- Declining respiratory status

**Special Considerations:**
- **Early is better** - swelling makes it impossible later
- May need larger tube than usual (swelling)
- Video laryngoscopy helpful
- Prepare for difficult airway
- Cricothyrotomy may be needed

**Don't Wait for:**
- Complete obstruction
- Severe stridor
- May be too late

---

## Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning - Detailed

### Pathophysiology

**How CO Works:**
- Binds to hemoglobin 200-250× stronger than oxygen
- Forms carboxyhemoglobin (COHb)
- Prevents oxygen release to tissues
- Shifts oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve left
- Binds to myoglobin (cardiac effects)

**Result:**
- Tissue hypoxia despite normal PaO₂
- "Internal suffocation"

---

### Clinical Presentation by COHb Level

**Mild (10-20% COHb):**
- Headache
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Dizziness

**Moderate (20-40% COHb):**
- Confusion
- Weakness
- Visual disturbances
- Chest pain (if CAD)

**Severe (40-60% COHb):**
- Syncope
- Seizures
- Coma

**Critical (>60% COHb):**
- Cardiac arrest
- Death

**NOTE:** Symptoms don't always correlate with level

---

### Why Pulse Oximetry Doesn't Work

**Normal Pulse Oximetry:**
- Uses 2 wavelengths of light
- Measures oxyhemoglobin vs deoxyhemoglobin
- Cannot distinguish COHb

**Problem:**
- COHb absorbs light similarly to oxyhemoglobin
- Reads as "oxygen"
- Shows falsely normal (95-100%)
- **Completely unreliable in CO poisoning**

**What Actually Measures CO:**
- CO-oximeter (special device)
- Arterial blood gas with co-oximetry
- Not available prehospital

---

### Treatment

**Prehospital:**
- 100% oxygen via non-rebreather
- High flow (15 L/min)
- Continue throughout transport

**Half-Life of CO:**
- Room air (21% O₂): 4-6 hours
- 100% O₂: 60-90 minutes
- Hyperbaric O₂ (100% at 3 ATM): 20-30 minutes

**Hospital May Use:**
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
- Criteria vary by facility
- COHb >25%, pregnant, altered mental status, cardiac issues

---

## Chemical Burns - Specific Agents

### Acids

**Common:**
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
- Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)
- Nitric acid (HNO₃)
- Hydrofluoric acid (HF) - special case

**Mechanism:**
- Coagulation necrosis
- Protein precipitation
- Forms eschar (barrier)
- Usually limits depth

**Treatment:**
- Copious water irrigation
- At least 20-30 minutes
- Continue en route if needed
- Remove all contaminated clothing

---

### Bases (Alkalis)

**Common:**
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) - drain cleaner
- Potassium hydroxide (KOH)
- Ammonia (NH₃)
- Cement (calcium hydroxide)

**Mechanism:**
- Liquefaction necrosis
- Saponification (dissolves fats)
- No eschar formation
- **Penetrates deeper than acids**
- **More serious injury**

**Treatment:**
- Copious water irrigation
- Longer irrigation needed (deeper penetration)
- May need 1-2 hours of irrigation
- Continue en route
- Often requires surgical debridement

---

### Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) - SPECIAL CASE

**Unique Properties:**
- Penetrates deeply
- Binds calcium and magnesium
- Can cause systemic toxicity
- Cardiac arrest from hypocalcemia/hyperkalemia

**Presentation:**
- Severe pain (often delayed)
- May not look bad initially
- Whitish tissue
- Systemic symptoms with large exposure

**Treatment:**
- Copious water irrigation
- **Calcium gluconate gel** (topical)
- May need **intralesional calcium gluconate** (Base Hospital order)
- May need **IV calcium** for systemic toxicity
- ECG monitoring (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia)
- **Contact Base Hospital immediately**

**High Risk With:**
- > 2-3% TBSA exposure
- Facial exposure
- Inhalation

---

### Phenol (Carbolic Acid)

**Properties:**
- Oily liquid
- Water doesn't remove well

**Treatment:**
- Polyethylene glycol preferred (if available)
- Otherwise: prolonged water irrigation
- Systemic toxicity possible

---

### Tar/Asphalt Burns

**Problem:**
- Adheres to skin
- Continues to burn

**Treatment:**
- **Cool with water** (hardens tar, stops burning)
- **Do NOT try to remove tar in field**
- Cover with non-adherent dressing
- Hospital will remove with mineral oil or petroleum jelly
- Attempting removal causes more damage

---

## Electrical Burns - Detailed Pathophysiology

### Path of Current

**Most Common:**
- Hand to hand (across chest)
- Hand to foot (through torso)

**Why Path Matters:**
- Damages all tissues along path
- Through chest = cardiac risk
- Through head = neurologic risk
- Muscles, nerves, vessels most damaged

---

### Factors Determining Injury Severity

**Ohm's Law:** I = V/R
- I = Current (amps)
- V = Voltage
- R = Resistance

**Voltage:**
- Low voltage: < 500-1000 V
- High voltage: > 500-1000 V
- Higher voltage = more damage

**Amperage (Current):**
- Actually determines injury severity
- Related to voltage and resistance

**Current Type:**
- **Alternating Current (AC):** More dangerous
  - Causes tetanic muscle contractions
  - "Can't let go"
  - Household current in US
- **Direct Current (DC):** Single strong contraction
  - Throws victim away from source
  - Lightning is DC

**Duration:**
- Longer contact = more damage
- AC can cause inability to release (tetany)

**Resistance:**
- Skin is high resistance (when dry)
- Wet skin much lower resistance (worse injury)
- Bone highest resistance (most heat generated)
- Blood vessels, nerves, muscles low resistance (current preferentially flows here)

---

### Cardiac Effects

**Mechanisms:**
- Direct electrical injury to myocardium
- Coronary artery vasospasm
- Autonomic dysfunction

**Immediate:**
- VF/VT (most common with AC)
- Asystole (more common with DC/lightning)
- Other dysrhythmias

**Delayed:**
- Dysrhythmias can occur hours later
- Myocardial injury (like MI)
- Heart blocks
- Myocarditis

**Why Monitor:**
- Risk persists for 24 hours
- Even if initially normal rhythm

**High Risk Criteria:**
- High voltage
- Current across chest (hand to hand)
- Loss of consciousness
- Initial dysrhythmia
- Abnormal ECG

---

### Rhabdomyolysis

**Mechanism:**
- Muscle destruction releases:
  - Myoglobin
  - Potassium
  - Phosphate
  - Creatine kinase (CK)

**Myoglobin:**
- Filters through kidneys
- Toxic to renal tubules
- Precipitates in tubules
- Acute kidney injury

**Signs:**
- Dark, tea-colored urine
- "Coca-cola" urine
- Decreased urine output

**Hospital Treatment:**
- Aggressive IV fluids
- Goal: High urine output
- Alkalinize urine
- Monitor kidney function

---

### Compartment Syndrome

**Mechanism:**
- Muscle swelling in fascial compartment
- Pressure rises
- Compresses blood vessels
- Ischemia

**Signs:**
- "5 P's":
  - Pain (out of proportion)
  - Pressure (tense compartment)
  - Pallor
  - Pulselessness (late)
  - Paresthesias

**Treatment:**
- Emergency fasciotomy
- Can't wait - limb at risk

**Prehospital:**
- Remove constricting items
- Check pulses frequently
- Document findings
- Rapid transport

---

## Lightning Injuries - Special Considerations

### Unique Characteristics

**Extremely High Voltage:**
- Millions of volts
- Very brief duration (milliseconds)
- Different injury pattern than industrial electrical

**Current Path:**
- Often external flashover
- Less deep tissue injury than industrial
- But still can have internal injuries

**Cardiac:**
- Asystole more common (DC current)
- May spontaneously return
- Respiratory arrest may last longer
- **Patient may need prolonged CPR**

---

### "Reverse Triage"

**Normal Triage:** Save those with best chance
**Lightning Triage:** Save those who appear dead

**Rationale:**
- Injured/conscious likely to survive
- Pulseless may recover with CPR
- Respiratory center stunned
- Cardiac automaticity may return
- Don't give up early

---

### Lightning Injury Patterns

**Lichtenberg Figures:**
- Fern-like pattern on skin
- Not actual burns
- From electron shower
- Pathognomonic for lightning
- Fade in 24 hours

**Other Patterns:**
- Linear burns
- Punctate burns
- Thermal burns (clothing ignition)

**Eyes/Ears:**
- Cataracts (may be delayed)
- Tympanic membrane rupture
- Hearing loss

**Neurologic:**

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ **Using ice** - causes more damage  
❌ **Trusting pulse ox** with smoke inhalation  
❌ **Delaying intubation** - wait too long, airway closes  
❌ **Forgetting to check distal pulses** - miss compartment syndrome  
❌ **Not irrigating chemical burns enough** - 5 minutes is not enough  
❌ **IV through burned skin** when non-burned area available  
❌ **Underestimating electrical burns** - looks minor, is major  
❌ **Excessive cooling** - causing hypothermia  
❌ **Not contacting Base Hospital** for Burn Unit criteria  
❌ **Trying to remove tar** in field - causes more damage
