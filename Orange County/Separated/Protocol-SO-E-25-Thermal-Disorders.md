## HYPOTHERMIA

### Definition

**Hypothermia:** Core body temperature < 35°C (95°F)

**Classifications:**
- **Mild:** 32-35°C (90-95°F) - Shivering, confused
- **Moderate:** 28-32°C (82-90°F) - Shivering stops, decreased LOC
- **Severe:** < 28°C (< 82°F) - Unconscious, appears dead

---

## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### HYPOTHERMIA - NOT IN CARDIAC ARREST

#### 1. Active Warming and Clothing Management

**Initiate active warming as available; remove any wet clothing and cover to conserve body heat.**

**Actions:**
- **Remove wet clothing** (cut off, don't make patient move excessively)
- **Active warming:**
  - Warm blankets (multiple layers)
  - Heat packs to chest, axillae, groin, neck
  - Heated ambulance
  - Cover head
- **Avoid extremities first** (risk of core temperature afterdrop)
- **Handle gently** (rough handling can trigger dysrhythmias)

---

#### 2. Cardiac Monitoring

**Cardiac monitor, document rhythm**

**Expected Findings:**
- Bradycardia common
- Atrial fibrillation
- **Osborn waves (J waves)** - diagnostic for hypothermia
- Prolonged intervals (PR, QRS, QT)
- VF or asystole (severe cases)

---

#### 3. Bradycardia Management

**Expect slow heart rate and weak pulse; do not attempt to reverse bradycardia in field.**

**⚠️ CRITICAL:**

**DO NOT Give:**
- ❌ Atropine (ineffective in hypothermia)
- ❌ Cardiac pacing (ineffective until rewarmed)
- ❌ Any medications to increase heart rate

**Why:**
- Bradycardia is physiologic response
- Appropriate for decreased metabolic state
- Medications ineffective in cold heart
- Rewarming will resolve bradycardia
- Accept slow vital signs as protective

---

#### 4. Transport

**Transport to nearest ERC.**

- Continue cardiac monitoring
- Continue rewarming
- Handle gently
- Watch for dysrhythmias

---

### HYPOTHERMIA - APPARENT CARDIAC ARREST (NOT OBVIOUSLY DEAD)

**"Not Obviously Dead" = No signs incompatible with life**

**Key Principle: "Nobody is dead until warm and dead"**

---

#### 1. Extended Pulse Assessment

**Monitor pulse for 30-45 seconds before initiating CPR.**

**If no pulse detected, treat using cardiac arrest SO (SO-C-10).**

**Why Extended Check:**
- Severe bradycardia may be 2-3 beats/minute
- Very weak pulse difficult to detect
- Don't want to do CPR if pulse present (can trigger VF)
- Full 30-45 seconds at carotid

**If Pulse Present:** Follow "Not in Cardiac Arrest" orders above

**If No Pulse After 30-45 Seconds:** Begin CPR per SO-C-10 + continue below

---

#### 2. Ventilation Management

**Assist ventilation with bag-valve-mask, avoid hyperventilation.**

- BVM with high-flow oxygen
- Normal rate (10-12 breaths/min)
- **Avoid hyperventilation** (worsens outcomes)
- Chest may be stiff
- Continue throughout resuscitation

---

#### 3. Active Warming During Resuscitation

**Initiate active warming as available; remove any wet clothing and cover to conserve body heat.**

- Same principles as non-arrest warming
- Remove wet clothing
- Heat packs to core
- Warm blankets
- Continue during CPR
- Warm IV fluids if possible

---

#### 4. Base Hospital Contact

**If further orders required for patient stabilization, contact Base Hospital.**

**Base Hospital May Order:**
- Medication modifications
- Continued resuscitation guidance
- Destination with rewarming capability
- Termination guidance (rarely)

---

#### 5. Transport - Do Not Pronounce

**Do not pronounce in field; ALS escort to nearest ERC.**

**⚠️ CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:**

**"NOBODY IS DEAD UNTIL WARM AND DEAD"**

**Why No Field Pronouncement:**
- Remarkable recoveries documented
- Hypothermia protective for brain
- Need hospital core rewarming
- Cannot determine viability until rewarmed to 32-35°C

**Continue Resuscitation:**
- Throughout transport
- Even if prolonged downtime
- ALS level care
- Active rewarming
- Cardiac monitoring

---

## Modified ACLS for Hypothermia

### Medications (Core Temp < 30°C / 86°F):

**Withhold ACLS medications:**
- Ineffective in cold heart
- May accumulate to toxic levels
- Give after rewarming begins

**If Core Temp ≥ 30°C:**
- Space medications at **longer intervals**
- Double time between doses
- Epinephrine every 6-10 min (instead of 3-5)

---

### Defibrillation for VF:

**Attempt defibrillation** once (standard dose)

**If unsuccessful and temp <30°C:**
- Continue CPR
- Focus on rewarming
- **Defer further shocks until >30°C**

**Once >30°C:**
- Resume normal defibrillation sequence

**Rationale:** Cold heart resistant to defibrillation

---

### CPR:

- Standard rate and depth
- May be difficult (chest stiff)
- **Continue during transport**
- **Continue during rewarming**
- **May need prolonged CPR** (hours documented)
- **Do NOT stop** even if prolonged downtime

---

## Clinical Recognition

### Signs of Hypothermia

**Mild:**
- Shivering (trying to generate heat)
- Confusion, poor judgment
- Tachycardia initially
- Ataxia

**Moderate:**
- **Shivering stops** (bad sign)
- Bradycardia
- Hypotension
- Decreased consciousness
- Cardiac irritability

**Severe:**
- Unconscious
- Very slow or absent pulse
- **May appear dead**
- Rigid muscles
- Minimal/absent respirations
- High VF risk

---

### Osborn Waves (J Waves)

**ECG Finding:**
- Small positive deflection at end of QRS
- Pathognomonic for hypothermia
- Larger as temperature drops

---

### Common Causes

**Environmental:**
- Cold exposure (homeless, outdoor activities)
- Water immersion
- Wet clothing in cold weather

**Medical:**
- Hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia
- Sepsis, stroke
- Adrenal insufficiency

**Toxicologic:**
- Alcohol (vasodilation + impaired judgment)
- Sedatives, opioids

**"Urban Hypothermia":**
- Can occur at mild temperatures
- Homeless population
- Prolonged exposure

---

## Rewarming Methods

### Passive Rewarming
- Remove from cold
- Insulation/blankets
- Increase: 0.5-1°C/hour

### Active External Rewarming (Prehospital)
- Heat packs (core areas)
- Warm blankets
- Warm vehicle
- Increase: 1-2°C/hour

### Active Core Rewarming (Hospital Only)
- Warmed IV fluids
- Warm humidified O₂
- Cardiopulmonary bypass (most effective)
- ECMO
- Increase: 2-10°C/hour

---

## Core Temperature Afterdrop

**Problem:**
- Warming extremities first causes cold blood to return to core
- Core temperature drops further
- Can trigger dysrhythmias

**Prevention:**
- Warm core, not extremities
- Chest, axillae, groin, neck
- Gentle handling

---

## Special Populations

**Elderly:**
- Higher risk even at mild temperatures
- Decreased shivering response
- May occur indoors

**Alcohol Intoxication:**
- Vasodilation causes heat loss
- Impaired judgment
- May not seek shelter
- Common in homeless population

---

## Quick Assessment Guide

### Is Patient in Cardiac Arrest?

**Check pulse for 30-45 seconds:**
- **Pulse present** → Not in arrest
  - Active warming
  - Monitor
  - DON'T treat bradycardia
  - Transport
  
- **No pulse after 45 seconds** → Cardiac arrest
  - Begin CPR
  - Active warming
  - Modified ACLS
  - DON'T pronounce
  - Transport with CPR

---

## Key Decision Points

### Should I Give Atropine for Bradycardia?

**NO - Never in hypothermia**
- Ineffective
- Can cause harm
- Bradycardia is protective
- Will resolve with rewarming

### Should I Defibrillate VF?

**YES - Once**
- Then focus on rewarming if temp <30°C
- Resume defibrillation when >30°C

### Should I Give ACLS Medications?

**If temp <30°C: NO - Withhold**
**If temp ≥30°C: YES - But space at longer intervals**

### Can I Pronounce Death in Field?

**NO - Never**
- "Not dead until warm and dead"
- Transport with CPR
- Hospital will determine after rewarming

---

## Documentation Requirements

**Required Elements:**
- Environmental conditions (where found, temperature, duration)
- Wet clothing present/removed
- Mental status
- Vital signs (especially heart rate - document bradycardia)
- Shivering present or absent
- Cardiac rhythm (Osborn waves if visible)
- Extended pulse check time (if cardiac arrest assessment)
- CPR performed (duration)
- Defibrillation attempts
- Medications withheld (with reason)
- Rewarming methods used
- Gentle handling documented
- Base Hospital contact if applicable
- Pronouncement NOT made
- Patient status during transport

---

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **"Not dead until warm and dead"** - no field pronouncement  
✓ **30-45 second pulse check** before CPR  
✓ **Do NOT treat bradycardia** - expected and protective  
✓ **Gentle handling** - dysrhythmias easily triggered  
✓ **Remove wet clothing** immediately  
✓ **Warm core, not extremities**  
✓ **Withhold ACLS meds if <30°C**  
✓ **One defibrillation if VF + <30°C**, then warm  
✓ **Never pronounce in field**  
✓ **Continue CPR throughout transport**  

---

## Common Errors to Avoid

❌ **Atropine for bradycardia** - ineffective  
❌ **Short pulse check** - may miss slow pulse  
❌ **Rough handling** - triggers dysrhythmias  
❌ **Warming extremities first** - afterdrop  
❌ **Normal ACLS dosing when <30°C** - toxic  
❌ **Multiple defibrillations <30°C** - ineffective  
❌ **Pronouncing death in field** - may be viable  
❌ **Stopping CPR** due to downtime - continue  
❌ **Hyperventilation** - worsens outcomes
