## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### AUTO ACCIDENT WITH AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT:

**1. For eye irritation, brush off and powder around upper face and irrigate with water.**

**2. Pulse oximetry, if oxygen saturation less than 95% provide:**

**► Oxygen by mask (high flow) or nasal cannula (6 L/m) as tolerated.**

**3. For respiratory distress with wheezes, administer albuterol:**

**► Albuterol, continuous nebulization of 5 mg/ 6 mL as tolerated.**

**4. Base contact required (CCERC base preferred) if meets Trauma Triage Criteria (OCEMS Policy #310.30)**

**5. If does not meet Trauma Triage Criteria, transport to nearest available ERC (ALS escort if Albuterol required).**

---

### EXTERNAL BLEEDING/ HEMORRHAGE:

**1. Apply direct pressure to bleeding site to control blood loss -**

• **If direct pressure successful in controlling extremity bleeding site, apply pressure dressing.**

• **For continued bleeding after application of direct pressure, consider use of hemostatic dressing with direct pressure.**

• **Use tourniquet application when upper or lower extremity bleeding is not controlled with direct pressure or hemostatic dressing with pressure dressing.**

**2. IV/IO access if hypotensive or per paramedic judgement (initiate transport as soon as possible):**

**Administer 20 mL/kg normal saline (maximum 250 mL) IV/IO bolus and make BH contact.**

**If remains hypotensive, may repeat same dose twice for total of three boluses as a standing order.**

**3. Make Base Hospital contact (CCERC base preferred) for all hypotensive hemorrhage cases for Trauma Center triage consideration.**

---

### EYE INJURY:

**1. Cover injured eye without applying pressure to globe if required to keep child from rubbing or touching eye.**

**2. Elevate head 30 degrees or more if spinal motion restriction not required.**

**3. Morphine sulfate or Fentanyl as needed for severe pain. Contact Base (CCERC base preferred) if less than or equal to 2 years-old:**

**► Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV/IM (maximum single dose of 5 mg), may repeat same dose once after 3 minutes (do not exceed total combined administration of 10 mg) OR**

**Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg IN/IV/IM (maximum single dose of 50 mcg), may repeat same dose once after 3 minutes (do not exceed total combined administration of 100 mcg)**

**4. For nausea or vomiting in a child 4 years or older, give Ondansetron (Zofran™):**

**► Ondansetron (Zofran™) 4 mg ODT tablet to dissolve orally.**

**5. Transport to nearest available ERC (ALS escort if medications administered).**

---

### ISOLATED EXTREMITY INJURY (FRACTURES OR DEEP LACERATIONS) NOT MEETING TRAUMA TRIAGE CRITERIA:

**1. Splint or immobilize fractured extremities (note breaks of skin or open wounds in fracture areas).**

**2. For fractures, note presence or absence of peripheral pulses and sensation.**

**3. Cover deep lacerations with sterile dressings if bleeding control not required.**

**4. Morphine sulfate or Fentanyl as needed for severe pain, Contact Base (CCERC base preferred) if less than or equal to 2 years-old:**

**Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV/IM (maximum single dose of 5 mg), may repeat same dose once after 3 minutes (do not exceed total combined administration of 10 mg) OR**

**Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg IN/IV/IM (maximum single dose of 50 mcg), may repeat same dose once after 3 minutes (do not exceed total combined administration of 100 mcg)**

**5. Transport to nearest ERC (ALS escort if morphine or fentanyl administered).**

---

### IMPALED OBJECTS NOT MEETING TRAUMA TRIAGE CRITERIA:

**1. Stabilize impaled object (in place) when possible unless causes delay in extrication or transport.**

**2. DO NOT remove impaled objects in face or neck unless breathing is compromised.**

**3. Morphine sulfate or Fentanyl as needed for severe pain, Contact Base (CCERC base preferred) if less than or equal to 2 years-old:**

**Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV/IM (maximum single dose of 5 mg), may repeat same dose once after 3 minutes (do not exceed total combined administration of 10 mg) OR**

**Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg IN/IV/IM (maximum single dose of 50 mcg), may repeat same dose once after 3 minutes (do not exceed total combined administration of 100 mcg)**

**4. Transport to nearest available ERC (ALS escort if morphine or fentanyl administered).**

### SUSPECTED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI)

**1. Monitor all patients with continuous Pulse Oximetry.**

**► Provide supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 6 L/min flow rate or high flow oxygen by face mask and maintain P.O. > 90%.**

**If unable to maintain P.O.> 90% with oxygen alone, reposition airway as appropriate (consider c-spine precautions). If P.O. now > 90%, continue monitoring.**

**If P.O. still < 90%, deliver positive pressure ventilation with bag-valve-mask in conjunction with airway adjuncts. If P.O. now > 90%, continue monitoring.**

**2. Monitor all patients with continuous End Tidal CO₂.**

**► Maintain ETCO₂ between 35 and 45 mmHg if possible, especially for ventilated patients.**

**3. Monitor systolic blood pressure for all patients every 5 minutes.**

**For patients aged 0 - 9 years:**

**Blood pressure below 70 + (age X 2) mmHg, administer 20 mL/kg Normal Saline IV/IO (maximum 250 mL), and repeat X 3 as standing order if needed to maintain systolic BP > 70 + (age X 2) mmHg.**

**For patients aged 10 years and older:**

**Blood pressure below 90 mmHg, administer 20 mL/kg Normal Saline IV/IO (maximum 250 mL), and repeat X 3 as standing order if needed to maintain systolic BP > 90 mmHg.**

**4. Assess GCS in all patients. For patients age ≤ 2 years, use P-GCS.**

**5. Transport to trauma center, Level 1 or Level 2 pediatric trauma center if possible.**
