# PREHOSPITAL ALS STANDING ORDERS / TREATMENT GUIDELINES
## SUSPECTED ACUTE STROKE OR INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE (STROKE TRIAGE CRITERIA)

**Protocol #:** SO-M-25  
**Page:** 1 of 2  
**Original Date:** 4/2009  
**Revised:** 7/18/2023

---

## ALS STANDING ORDERS:

### 1. Base Hospital Contact

**Contact Base Hospital if patient meets Stroke-Neurology Triage Criteria (see below).**

---

### 2. NPO Status

**Give no fluid or solids orally (may be risk for aspiration); dissolving Ondansetron in mouth is appropriate.**

---

### 3. Cardiac Monitoring

**Monitor cardiac rhythm and document with rhythm strip.**

---

### 4. Oxygen Therapy

**Pulse oximetry, if room-air oxygen saturation less than 95%:**

**► Provide high flow oxygen by mask or nasal cannula 6 L/min flow rate as tolerated.**

---

### 5. Blood Glucose Assessment and Treatment

**Blood glucose analysis, if blood glucose less than 60, administer one of:**

**► 10% Dextrose 250 mL IV.**

**► Glucagon 1 mg IM if unable to establish IV.**

**Note:** IO access may be used for dextrose administration when patient is unconscious with blood glucose less than 60, unable to establish IV and there is no response to IM glucagon.

---

### 6. Antiemetic for Nausea/Vomiting

**For nausea or vomiting, and not suspected or known to be pregnant:**

**Ondansetron (Zofran®): ODT 8 mg (two 4 mg tablets) to dissolve orally on inside of cheek;**  
**OR,**  
**4 mg IV, may repeat after approximately 3 minutes for continued nausea or vomiting.**

---

### 7. Transport Decision

**If patient does not meet Stroke Triage Criteria, ALS escort to nearest ERC.**

---

## STROKE TRIAGE CRITERIA (ADULT):

### 1. Type of Stroke Suspected

#### Ischemic Stroke Suspected:

✓ **Last seen at usual neurological baseline within the past 24 hours, and**

✓ **Responds in an appropriate manner to verbal or visual stimuli or has spontaneous eye opening, and**

✓ **Demonstrates one or more of the following as new onset neurologic signs:**
- Arm (pronator) drift or paralysis, asymmetric to right or left arm
- Facial paresis or droop (new onset).
- Decreased grip strength, asymmetric to right or left hand

---

#### Intracerebral Hemorrhage Suspected:

**a. Sudden, severe headache with onset in past 24 hours with any one of:**

✓ Vomiting (repeated), or

✓ Neurological deficit (hemi-paresis or weakness, gaze to one side, or asymmetric pupils without prior eye surgery), or

✓ Altered mental status, or

✓ Marked blood pressure elevation (diastolic > 100 mm Hg).

**b. Unable to obtain history of severe headache due to altered mental status with any one of:**

✓ Vomiting (repeated) without other obvious cause, or

✓ Neurological deficit (hemi-paresis or weakness, gaze to one side, or asymmetric pupils without prior eye surgery), or

✓ Marked blood pressure elevation (diastolic > 100 mm Hg)

✓ Paramedic judgment that patient is suffering from an acute intracerebral bleed.

---

### 2. Base Hospital Contact Required

**Base contact required on all Stroke Triage designations to alert receiving facility stroke team to prepare to immediately accept patient.**

---

### 3. IV Line Placement Considerations

**Avoid intraosseous and external jugular lines for potential SNRC patients as these lines may allow for uncontrolled bleeding without the ability to compress the bleeding site if a patient receives thrombolytics.**

---

### 4. Time Documentation

**Document the "last known well" time or onset time of stroke symptoms reported by patient, family or witness to allow receiving Stroke-Neurology Receiving Center (SNRC) to determine eligibility for time sensitive treatments.**

---

## Key Points

✓ **Base Hospital contact REQUIRED** for all stroke triage designations  
✓ **NPO (nothing by mouth)** - aspiration risk  
✓ **Last known well time** is critical - document carefully  
✓ **Avoid IO and EJ lines** - may bleed if thrombolytics given  
✓ **Check glucose** - hypoglycemia can mimic stroke  
✓ **Ischemic stroke criteria:** baseline < 24 hrs + responds + focal deficit  
✓ **Hemorrhagic stroke criteria:** severe headache + neuro signs or altered mental status  
✓ **Time is brain** - rapid assessment and transport  

---

## Stroke Recognition

### Ischemic Stroke Signs (Most Common):

**Focal Neurologic Deficits:**
- **Arm drift or paralysis** (asymmetric)
- **Facial droop** (new onset, one-sided)
- **Grip weakness** (asymmetric)
- Speech difficulty (slurred, unable to speak)
- Vision changes
- Ataxia, difficulty walking

**Time Frame:** Last seen normal within 24 hours

---

### Hemorrhagic Stroke Signs:

**Classic Presentation:**
- **Sudden, severe "thunderclap" headache**
- "Worst headache of my life"
- Onset in past 24 hours

**Plus any of:**
- Repeated vomiting
- Neurological deficit
- Altered mental status
- Very high blood pressure (diastolic > 100)

**OR if patient altered and can't give history:**
- Signs above without obvious other cause
- Paramedic judgment of intracerebral bleed

---

## Last Known Well Time

**Critical for Treatment Decisions**

**"Last Known Well"** = Last time patient was at neurological baseline (normal for them)

**How to Determine:**
- When was patient last seen acting normally?
- When did symptoms start?
- If found with symptoms: when last known to be normal?
- If woke up with symptoms: time went to sleep (assume occurred during sleep)

**Document:**
- Specific time if known
- "Found at 0800, last seen normal at 2200 last night"
- If unknown: "Unable to determine - patient lives alone"

**Why It Matters:**
- Thrombolytics (clot busters) time-limited
- Usually within 4.5 hours for IV tPA
- Thrombectomy possible up to 24 hours in some cases
- Every minute counts

---

## NPO (Nothing By Mouth)

**Why NPO:**
- Stroke patients at high risk for aspiration
- May have dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
- May need emergency procedures
- Decreased gag reflex common

**Nothing Orally Means:**
- No food
- No drinks
- No medications by mouth

**EXCEPT:**
- Ondansetron ODT (dissolves in cheek, not swallowed)
- This is specifically allowed

---

## IV Access Considerations

**Avoid for Stroke Patients:**
- **Intraosseous (IO)** lines
- **External jugular (EJ)** lines

**Why Avoid:**
- Patient may receive thrombolytics (clot busters)
- These cause bleeding risk
- IO and EJ cannot be compressed if they bleed
- Uncontrolled bleeding dangerous

**Preferred:**
- Peripheral IV in arm
- Can be compressed if needed
- Safer with thrombolytics

**Exception:**
- If patient critically unstable
- May need IO for access
- Clinical judgment

---

## Blood Glucose Importance

**Always Check Glucose in Stroke Patients**

**Why:**
- Hypoglycemia mimics stroke
- Can cause focal deficits
- Can cause altered mental status
- Easily treatable

**If Glucose < 60:**
- Treat per protocol
- 10% Dextrose 250 mL IV
- Glucagon 1 mg IM if no IV
- IO for dextrose if unconscious, no IV, glucagon failed

**After Treating:**
- Reassess neurologic status
- If deficits resolve → was hypoglycemia
- If deficits persist → likely stroke

---

## Base Hospital Contact

**Required for ALL Stroke Triage Designations**

**Purpose:**
- Alert receiving facility stroke team
- Activate stroke response
- Prepare for immediate acceptance
- Coordinate rapid treatment

**Information to Provide:**
- Patient age
- **Last known well time** (critical)
- Current symptoms/deficits
- Stroke scale results (if performed)
- Vital signs
- Blood glucose
- ETA

**Base Hospital Will:**
- Confirm stroke center destination
- Notify receiving hospital
- May provide additional orders
- Coordinate care

---

## Stroke Scales (If Used Locally)

**Common Scales:**
- Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale
- Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen
- FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time)

**Components Usually Include:**
- Facial droop
- Arm drift
- Speech abnormality
- Time of onset

**Document:**
- Scale used
- Results
- Time performed

---

## Special Considerations

### Patient on Anticoagulants:

**Higher Risk for:**
- Intracerebral hemorrhage
- Bleeding complications

**Document:**
- Warfarin (Coumadin)
- DOACs (Eliquis, Xarelto, Pradaxa)
- Aspirin, Plavix

### Previous Stroke History:

- Document baseline deficits
- Compare to current presentation
- Old deficits vs new deficits

### Seizure vs Stroke:

- Seizure can cause post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis
- Usually resolves within hours
- May need stroke workup anyway
- Document if seizure witnessed

---

## Transport

**If Meets Stroke Triage Criteria:**
- Base Hospital contact (required)
- Stroke-Neurology Receiving Center (SNRC)
- Lights and sirens
- Notify hospital early
- Rapid transport

**If Does NOT Meet Criteria:**
- ALS escort to nearest ERC
- Still evaluate for other causes
- Document why criteria not met

---
