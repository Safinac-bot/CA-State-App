## INDICATION:

Decompression of tension pneumothorax causing hemodynamic instability in a chest injury victim.

**IMPORTANT:** absence of breath sounds and/or shortness of breath alone are not sufficient to indicate a tension pneumothorax. Any of the signs and symptoms listed below must be associated with at least hypoxia **OR** hemodynamic instability to justify a needle thoracostomy.

---

## SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX CAUSING HEMODYNAMIC INSTABILITY:

**Signs include:**

• Chest injury, either blunt or penetrating (often with flail chest, palpable subcutaneous air, or "sucking" chest wound on side of suspected pneumothorax).

• Absence of breath sounds on the side of the suspected pneumothorax (if breathing); while presence of breath sounds on side without pneumothorax.

• Distended neck veins.

• Circulatory collapse, manifested by hypotension or signs of poor perfusion

• Respiratory arrest

**Symptoms include:**

• Progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath)

---

## EQUIPMENT:

• 3.25 inch ARS chest decompression needle (10 G, catheter over needle); or 14 G, minimum 2.5 inch catheter over needle

• Antiseptic skin wipes

• Sterile Vaseline gauze or 4" X 4" dressings and tape

---

## PROCEDURE:

• Base Contact (if in the setting of an MCI, remote rescue, or tactically unstable scene proceed without base contact and document).

• Explain procedure to patient if conscious.

• Assemble equipment:

• Identify second intercostal space, midclavicular line.

• Prepare site with sterile skin wipe.

• Insert needle using steady pressure and ninety degree angle (perpendicular) to chest wall in lower aspect of the second intercostal space within the midclavicular line.

• Advance needle until one of the following are recognized:

  - A sudden rush of air is expelled through the needle
  - A "popping" or "giving way" is felt as the tip of the needle enters the chest cavity
  - Blood or fluid is expelled through the needle

## NEEDLE THORACOSTOMY: ADULT / ADOLESCENT (Page 2 of 2)

• Remove needle and leave catheter in place (do not reinsert needle into catheter due to risk of shearing apart plastic catheter).

• Secure catheter with Vaseline gauze alone or 4" X 4" dressing and tape.

• Assess and document any improvement in respiratory status and hemodynamic status.
