## ⚠️ BASE HOSPITAL CONTACT REQUIRED

## ALS STANDING ORDERS

### 1. CPR

**Initiate and maintain uninterrupted CPR**

---

### 2. Spinal Motion Restriction

**Initiate or maintain spinal motion restriction as appropriate.**

---

### 3. Base Hospital Contact

**Make early base contact for destination determination when transport indicated.**

---

### 4. Airway Management

**Maintain open airway, assess for upper airway obstruction:**

**► Assist ventilation/oxygenation with BVM and high flow supplemental oxygen.**

---

### 5. Cardiac Monitoring

**Monitor cardiac rhythm:**

**► For bradycardia, ensure airway is open and provide high flow oxygen by mask, nasal cannula, or blow-by as is indicated and tolerated.**

---

### 6. Vascular Access and Fluid Resuscitation

**IV/IO access; if unable to place IV, establish IO access (do not delay transport to establish IV or IO):**

**Infuse 20 mL/kg normal saline (maximum 250 mL) IV/IO fluid bolus and make BH contact.**

**May repeat same dose twice for total of three boluses as a standing order.**

---

### 7. Tension Pneumothorax Management

**If chest injury and suspected tension pneumothorax:**

**Place Needle Thoracostomy to side of chest with absent breath sounds.**

**► Place bilateral Needle Thoracostomy when bilateral chest trauma observed.**

---

### 8. Transport

**Transport to Trauma Center as directed by Base Hospital (CCERC base preferred).**

---

### 9. Epinephrine Consideration

**If trauma is clearly the cause of cardiopulmonary arrest (gunshot wound to the chest, pedestrian hit by a car at high speed, etc), administration of epinephrine is not indicated.**

---

## TREATMENT GUIDELINES

**Trauma arrest patients for who resuscitation and transport is pursued should be triaged as follows:**

• **Unmanageable airway - Base Hospital triage to closest appropriate Trauma Center**

• **Penetrating or blunt traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest (including pregnant women) - Base Hospital triage to closest appropriate Trauma Center.**

**Transport of trauma victims should be rapid with treatment enroute when possible.**
