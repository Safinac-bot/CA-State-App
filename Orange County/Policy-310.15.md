A life support team AEMT or EMT-P (Paramedic) operates under standard policies and procedures developed by the local EMS agency and approved by their Medical Director under the Authority of Division 2.5 of the California Health and Safety Code. The drugs they carry and procedures they can do are restricted by law and local policy.

If you want to assist, this can only be done through one of the alternatives listed on the back of this card. These alternatives have been endorsed by CMA, State EMS Authority, CCLHO, and BMQA. Assistance rendered in the endorsed fashion, without compensation, is covered by the protection of the "Good Samaritan Code" (see Business and Professions Code, Sections 2144, 2395-2398 and Health and Safety Code, Section 1799.104).
