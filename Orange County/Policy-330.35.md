---

**Distribution:**
1. The original and first copy are sent to the address above, and the second copy retained by the reporting agency or person.

2. The registry form may also be used for reporting suspicion of abuse situations where there is reasonable concern that a dependent adult or elder is being subjected to abuse, neglect, or exploitation.

3. Additional forms and answers to questions regarding elder and dependent adult abuse or reporting requirements may be obtained by calling the APS Registry at **(800) 451-5155.**

---

### E. Team Reporting

When two or more mandated reporters are present and jointly have knowledge or reasonably suspect that types of abuse of an elder or a dependent adult for which a report is or is not mandated have occurred, and when there is agreement among them, the telephone report may be made by a member of the team selected by mutual agreement, and a single report may be made and signed by the selected member of the reporting team. 

**Record the name of the reporting agency in the PCR. Use the phrase, "Report to be filed by (reporting agency name)".** Avoid stating the report is for elder abuse/neglect to protect confidentiality in case the suspected abuser requests a copy of the medical record. 

**Any member who has knowledge that the member designated to report has failed to do so shall thereafter make the report. Any person who fails to report an instance of elder or dependent adult abuse is guilty of a misdemeanor.**

---

### F. Liability Protection

No care custodian, clergy member, health practitioner, or employee of an adult protective service agency or a local law enforcement agency who reports a known or suspected instance of elder or dependent adult abuse shall be civilly or criminally liable for any report required or authorized by this policy.

---

### G. PCR Documentation

PCR documentation should include a thorough narrative documenting **objective findings.**
