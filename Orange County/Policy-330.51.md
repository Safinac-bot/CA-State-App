## V. GUIDELINES FOR HONORING A DO-NOT-RESUSCITATE ORDER:

### A. Supportive Care

DNR patients shall receive **non-resuscitation related supportive care and other comfort measures** as would any other person.

---

### B. Patient Requests Resuscitation

A DNR directive shall be **disregarded if the patient requests resuscitative measures.**

---

### C. Verification

EMS personnel shall honor a DNR request when it can be reasonably established that the patient is the subject of the DNR request and the DNR order is available for verification.

---

### D. Verbal DNR Requests

EMS personnel may accept a verbal request to withhold or withdraw resuscitative measures under the following circumstances:

#### 1. Physician Present

The patient's physician present with the patient gives a verbal DNR order.
- The physician's name, address, telephone number, and medical license number should be recorded within the PCR.

#### 2. Attorney-in-Fact / Health Care Agent

A DNR request is communicated by an "attorney-in-fact" or "health care agent."
- The attorney-in-fact name, address, and telephone number should be recorded within the PCR.

#### 3. Immediate Family Decision

Immediate family, present at the scene, may decline resuscitative measures on behalf of the patient if the following conditions are met:

**a.** In the absence of any documentation supporting the family's request (POLST, DNR, Durable Power of Attorney, or other AHCD), the decision to decline/discontinue resuscitative measures **must be supported by the MICN in consultation with the base hospital physician** before paramedics may withhold care. As such, **base hospital contact is necessary.** After base hospital agreement is obtained, if all immediate family members on scene and paramedics agree with terminating resuscitation, paramedics may cease patient care activities and withhold further care.

**b.** The name(s) of the immediate family who made the decision to withhold or withdraw resuscitative measures shall be documented on the PCR.

**c.** The immediate family member shall sign the PCR in the patient signature area.

---

### E. Documentation

When a DNR is honored by EMS personnel, they should note within the PCR that a DNR order was present and honored.

---

### F. DNR in Cardiac Arrest - No Transport

DNR patients who are in cardiopulmonary arrest **should not be transported.** EMS personnel will contact the local law enforcement agency and/or coroner's office to report the death and support family members on scene as appropriate.

---

### G. DNR Declines Transport

DNR patients who decline transport to the hospital, including those patients for whom transport is declined on their behalf, should not be transported. Preservation of the patient's privacy, dignity, and concern for comfort measures must be assured prior to EMS personnel leaving the scene.

---

### H. DNR Patient Transported

If a DNR patient is transported to a hospital, the following apply:

1. A DNR order/directive, DNR medallion, or POLST form shall be honored during transport of the patient.

2. The DNR order/directive, DNR medallion, or POLST form shall accompany the patient.

3. The attorney-in-fact (if applicable) should also go to the hospital.

4. **If a DNR patient experiences a cardiac arrest during transport, continue on to the hospital but do not initiate CPR.** The emergency physician will declare the patient dead.

5. Items V.F. and V.H.1.-4. above also apply to patients covered by the End of Life Option Act.

---

### J. POLST Form

The POLST should be with the patient and be viewed by the EMS providers, unless the patient's physician is present and issues a DNR order. The EMS provider should review the levels of care in **Sections A and B (See 330.51 Attachment 2)** and care should be provided consistent with that documented.

---

### K. END OF LIFE OPTION ACT (Death with Dignity Act)

The END OF LIFE OPTION ACT allows a qualified patient who has obtained an aid-in-dying drug to end their life. The following guidelines are provided for EMS personnel when responding to a patient who has self-administered an aid-in-dying drug as applied to the END OF LIFE OPTION ACT.

#### 1. Final Attestation Form

Within 48 hours prior to self-administering the aid-in-dying drug, the patient is required to complete a **"Final Attestation For An Aid-In-Dying Drug to End My Life in a Humane and Dignified Manner".** However, there is no mandate for the patient to maintain the final attestation in close proximity of the patient. If a copy of the final attestation is available, EMS personnel should confirm the patient is the person named in the final attestation. This will normally require either the presence of a form of identification or a witness who can reliably identify the patient.

#### 2. Verify Final Attestation

There are no standardized "Final Attestation For An Aid-In-Dying Drug to End My Life in a Humane and Dignified Manner" forms but the law has required specific information that must be in the final attestation. If available, EMS personnel should make a good faith effort to review and verify that the final attestation contains the following information:

**a.** The document is identified as a "Final Attestation for an Aid-In-Dying Drug to End My Life in a Humane and Dignified Manner"

**b.** Patient's name, signature and dated

#### 3. Comfort Measures

Provide comfort measures (airway positioning, suctioning) and/or airway/ventilation measures when applicable.

#### 4. Withhold Resuscitation

Withhold resuscitative measures if patient is in cardiopulmonary arrest. If a POLST or AHCD is present, follow the directive as appropriate for the clinical situation.

#### 5. Patient Withdraws Request

The patient may at any time withdraw or rescind his or her request for an aid-in dying drug regardless of the patient's mental state. In this instance, EMS personnel shall provide medical care based on the discussion with the patient and as per standard protocols. EMS personnel are encouraged to consult with their base hospital in these situations.

#### 6. Family Objection

Family members may be at the scene of a patient who has self-administered an aid-in-dying drug. If there is objection to the End of Life Option Act, inform the family that comfort measures will be provided and consider Base Hospital contact for further direction.

#### 7. Documentation

Obtain a copy of the final attestation if possible and photograph into PCR documentation.
