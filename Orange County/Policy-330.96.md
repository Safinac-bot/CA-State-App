## IV. PROCEDURE:

### A. Emergency Response Employee Actions

Emergency response employees who believe they have been exposed to an infectious disease listed above should **immediately refer to their employer's internal policy** for direction and advice on evaluation and treatment. They should notify their employer's **Designated Officer**, who will determine whether an exposure may have occurred and, if that is the case, submit a request for assessment to the Emergency Receiving Center (ERC) that receives the patient, or, if the patient is pronounced dead in the field, to the coroner. 

Exchange of source patient information may be facilitated if the emergency response employee **registers as an emergency department patient, within 24 hours of their exposure incident,** at the ERC where the source patient was received.

#### 1. High-Risk Exposures - Immediate Evaluation

Cases where the prehospital care worker has been exposed to:
- A puncture with a large-bore needle
- Deep penetration and/or the injection of blood (visible blood on device)
- Other high-risk exposure, or
- Exposure to an uncommon or rare potentially life-threatening infectious disease

**Should be evaluated immediately.**

#### 2. Non-Immediate Evaluation

When the exposed emergency response employee is not immediately evaluated in the ERC, the Designated Officer shall make appropriate inquiries to the ERC.

---

### B. Emergency Receiving Center (ERC) Responsibilities

ERCs shall receive and evaluate reports of infectious disease exposures. They shall designate an in-house contact person for liaison with emergency response employees, Designated Officers, and the Health Department. The contact person shall be responsible for evaluating exposures to potentially life-threatening infectious diseases, including reporting the later diagnosis of airborne infectious diseases. 

**Note:** The reporting of exposures outlined below does not replace legally mandated reporting by health care providers of reportable diseases under the California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 2500 (see http://ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/dcepi/epi/physprov/report for list of reportable diseases)

#### 1. Transmittal Form - Immediate

An **"Orange County Public Health Communicable Disease Exposure Transmittal Form"** will be completed and signed by the physician or designee, and transmitted by **facsimile (714) 565-3788 immediately** to the Health Officer via Health Care Agency (HCA) Employee Health Services if an exposure to a potentially life-threatening infectious disease has occurred (see attached form).

#### 2. Test Results - Update

When a laboratory test is completed, and the diagnosis is confirmed, the transmittal shall be updated and sent by facsimile to the HCA Employee Health Services for follow-up care, or the update can be telephoned directly to the **HCA Employee Health Services (714) 565-3780.** This is a 24-hour message line.

#### 3. Reportable Diseases - Coordination

In the case of reportable communicable diseases, HCA Employee Health Services shall coordinate with HCA Epidemiology, the emergency response employee and Designated Officer to assure that any necessary laboratory tests are performed, that initial counseling occurs, and that follow-up will be assured through the employer's designated health care provider. **HCA Epidemiology does not follow-up on blood-borne pathogen exposures.**

---

### C. Provider Agency - Designated Officer

Provider agencies shall maintain a **Designated Officer** to respond to employee inquiries regarding possible infectious disease exposures and to coordinate with hospitals, the Health Department, and coroner as indicated. Designated Officers may refer to the Health Officer (Health Department) case information for evaluation where there has been insufficient information to make a determination that an employee was "exposed."

---

### D. Technical Assistance

ERC personnel and/or Designated Officers may request that HCA Employee Health evaluate the possible exposure, notify the emergency response employee, and/or provide other technical assistance.
