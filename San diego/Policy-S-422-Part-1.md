APPLICATION OF PATIENT RESTRAINTS - PART 1 OF 2
Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 2

I. PURPOSE

To establish criteria for the use of restraints in the field or during transport
II. AUTHORITY: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1798; and California Code of
Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 3.1, Section 100066.02 and Chapter 3.3, Section
100096.02.
III. POLICY
A. When field personal apply restraints, the safety of the patient, community, and responding
personnel shall be of paramount concern.
B. Whenever patient restraints have been applied in the field, prehospital personnel shall
document in the Prehospital Patient Record (PPR) the following:
1. The reason the restraints were needed (including previous attempts to control patient prior
to restraint use)
2. The type of restraint used, the extremity(ies) restrained, the time the restraints were applied
3. Which agency applied the restraints
4. Information and data regarding the monitoring of circulation to the restrained extremity(ies)
5. Information regarding the monitoring of the patient's respiratory status while restrained
C. Restraints should be used only when less restrictive techniques are unsuccessful, impractical,
or likely to endanger the patient or others. Attempts to enlist the patient's cooperation should
be made prior to restraint application.
D. If the patient is actively spitting, a surgical mask or oxygen mask (with a minimum 6L/O2 for
simple oxygen masks and 10-15L/O2 for non-rebreather masks) may be placed over the
patient's mouth to protect Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel and others. If this
method fails, a light weight, sheer, protective mesh hood may be used. When placed over the
patient's head, their mouth and/or nose shall never be obstructed. The mesh hood may never
be tightened in any manner to secure it around the patient's neck.

1. Constant observation by prehospital personnel is required. Use and jurisdiction of the mesh
hood must be documented in detail.
E. Prehospital personnel must consider that aggressive or violent behavior may be a symptom of
a medical condition.
F. The method of restraint used shall allow for adequate monitoring of vital signs and shall not
restrict the ability to protect the patient's airway, or compromise the neurological or circulatory
status of the restrained extremity(ies).
G. If the patient has been restrained by a law enforcement officer (such as handcuffs, plastic ties,
or "hobble" restraints, the following criteria must be met:
1. Restraints must provide sufficient slack in the restraint device to allow the patient to
straighten the abdomen and chest and to take full tidal volume breaths.
2. Restraints applied by law enforcement require the officer's continued presence to ensure
patient and scene management safety. The officer shall accompany the patient in the
ambulance. In the unusual event that this is not possible, the officer should follow by driving
in tandem with the ambulance on a pre-determined route.
a. Prior to leaving the scene, prehospital personnel shall attempt to discuss an appropriate
method to alert the officer of any problems that may develop during the transport
requiring the officer's immediate presence.
3. Law enforcement personnel shall attempt, when possible, to modify their restraints to a
medically accepted standard prior to transport.
a. This policy is not intended to negate the use by law enforcement personnel of appropriate
restraint equipment that is approved by their respective agencies to establish scene
management control.
H. Restraints or protective devices that have been applied by medical personnel prior to transport
may be continued during the transport per instructions from those medical personnel.
