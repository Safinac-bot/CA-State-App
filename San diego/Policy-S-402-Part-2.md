PREHOSPITAL DETERMINATION OF DEATH - PART 2 OF 2
Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 1
E. For patients with written POLST that documents do not resuscitate of signed "Do Not
Resuscitate" orders, follow procedures as established in County of San Diego, Emergency
Medical Services (CoSD EMS) Policy S-414 "Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)".
F. Special Considerations
1. In cases of obvious death, a monitor need not be used to determine death.
2. If monitor is used, a patient with a rhythm other than asystole requires a BHPO for
determination of death.
3. If victims of hypothermia, electrocution, lightning strike, or drowning do not meet obvious
death criteria, determination of death requires a BHPO.
4. In any situation where there may be doubt as to the clinical findings of the patient, BLS/CPR
must be initiated.
G. Aeromedical Considerations
1. It is not the responsibility of aeromedical prehospital personnel to pronounce the death of a
patient in the prehospital care setting. However, there may be situations where the flight
nurse is called upon to determine death on scene.
a. If, despite resuscitation efforts, the patient remains pulseless and apneic, the flight nurse
may determine death on scene.
2. When a death has been determined, no BLS/ALS shall be initiated or continued.
a. The flight nurse is authorized to discontinue CPR or ALS care initiated at the scene.
b. The appropriate law enforcement agency must be notified.
c. In situations where no other EMS personnel or authorized personal are available, the
flight crew will remain on scene until released by law enforcement.
d. The flight crew will document on the PPR and the flight record the patient's name (if
known), the criteria for determination of death, the time the death was determined, and
resuscitation efforts discontinued.
