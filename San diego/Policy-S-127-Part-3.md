Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 4
ASYSTOLE / TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION
§Applies to cardiac arrests of presumed cardiac origin. Excludes drowning, hypothermia, trauma, and
electrocution.
ASYSTOLE
• CPR
• Epinephrine 1:10,000 1 mg IV/IO q3-5 min
TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION (TOR)
Resuscitation may be terminated on SO§ if all the following conditions are met:
• Persistent asystole (NO other rhythms detected)
• Unwitnessed arrest (by bystanders or EMS)
• No bystander CPR
• No AED or other defibrillation
• No return of pulses
• ≥20 min on-scene resuscitation time
Base Hospital contact is not required if all criteria are met, even if ALS interventions are
performed
• Document time of death recognition, full name of paramedic making determination of apparent
death, and circumstances under TOR determination
BHPO is required for TOR for all other presentations, rhythms, and situations
• Document time of death pronouncement, full name of physician, and circumstances under which
TOR was ordered

RETURN OF SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION
3 Do not change destination if already enroute to an ECPR Receiving Center.
• Ventilate PRN (goal of EtCO2 = 40 mmHg)
• Obtain BP
• Obtain 12-lead ECG
• Transport to closest STEMI Center3 regardless of 12-lead ECG reading
• Provide cardiac monitor data to agency QA/QI department
• Monitor blood glucose PRN
SBP <90 mmHg
• If rales not present, 250 mL fluid bolus IV/IO, MR Ⓐ
• Push-dose epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg/mL) 1 mL IV/IO. MR q3 min, titrate to SBP ≥90 mmHg
Push-dose epinephrine mixing instructions
1. Remove 1 mL normal saline (NS) from the 10
mL NS syringe
2. Add 1 mL of epinephrine 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL)
to 9 mL NS syringe
The mixture now has 10 mL of epinephrine at 0.01
mg/mL (10 mcg/mL) concentration.

 EXTRACORPOREAL CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (ECPR) CRITERIA4

4 If patient meets ECPR criteria, make base hospital contact and transport IMMEDIATELY to an ECPR Receiving Center (per S-127A).
Age 18-70
Witnessed cardiac arrest
CPR
• Must be established within 5 minutes of cardiac arrest
• High-quality compressions throughout resuscitation, including during transport
Use of automated mechanical chest compression device
Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation/Pulseless VT
• Defined as persistent pulseless shockable rhythm after 2 defibrillation attempts (including AEDdelivered shocks, but not AICD firings)
Time interval from cardiac arrest to arrival at ECPR receiving center ≤45 minutes
