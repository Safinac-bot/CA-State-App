I. PURPOSE

A. The goal of Emergency Department Ambulance Diversion is to transport emergency patients to
the most accessible and appropriate medical facility which is staffed, equipped, and prepared to
administer emergency care appropriate to the needs and requests of the patient.
B. To provide a mechanism for a receiving hospital to request, or EMS Duty Officer to initiate,
Diversion of patients from an emergency department when it has been determined that the
hospital is not staffed, equipped, and/or prepared to care for additional patients.
C. To optimize emergency medical care resource use and assure prehospital provider units are not
unnecessarily removed from their area of primary response when transporting patients to a
hospital.
D. To ensure that individual patients receive appropriate medical care while preserving system
capacity to respond to emergencies.
II. AUTHORITY: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Sections 1797.220, 1797.222, and 1798;
and California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Section 1105 (c).

III. DEFINITION(S)
ALS Transporting Unit: An emergency response vehicle utilized for patient transport which is
staffed with a minimum of one paramedic.
Emergency Department Diversion: A hospital status that reroutes incoming ambulances to other
hospitals due to emergency department saturation and/or a lack of medical capability (i.e., lack of
CT capability, lack of ED physician). Status when a hospital cannot accept any ambulance patients
except for those:
• In non-traumatic cardiac arrest, or
• With unresolved anaphylaxis, or
• Who are unable to be effectively ventilated with a bag-valve-mask (BVM) (unmanageable
airway), or

• With uncontrolled non-traumatic hemorrhage.
Specialty Diversion: A hospital status that reroutes incoming ambulances with a specific type of
emergency patient due to inadequate medical capabilities. The types of specialty diversion are:
• ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Diversion: Status when a hospital cannot
accept emergency STEMI patients.
• Trauma Diversion: Status when a hospital cannot accept emergency trauma patients
(Refer to T-712).
• Stroke Diversion: Status when a hospital cannot accept emergency stroke patients.
• Obstetrics/Labor & Delivery (OB/L&D) Diversion: Status when a hospital cannot accept
emergency OB patients or emergency patients in L&D.
Internal Disaster Diversion: A hospital cannot accept any patients through the 9-1-1 system
because of a critical disruption of the ability to provide medical services (e.g., due to structural
failures, infrastructure disruptions, or health and safety threats).
Emergency Department Saturation: Hospital's emergency department resources are fully
committed and are not available for additional incoming ambulance patients.
Ambulance Patient Offload Time (APOT): The interval of time between the arrival of an
ambulance patient at an emergency department and the time the patient is transferred to an
emergency department gurney, bed, chair, or other acceptable location and the emergency
department assumes responsibility for the patient. Standard APOT is 30 minutes or less.
IV. POLICY
A. It is the expectation that all hospitals receiving 9-1-1 patients make every effort to be
continuously open and available.
B. Criteria for Diversion
1. ED Diversion may be initiated by the hospital or by the County of San Diego EMS (CoSD
EMS) due to the following:
a. Emergency department saturation:
1) A sudden, unanticipated, temporary inability to receive any additional 9-1-1 patients
due to critical lack of ED capacity.
b. Nonstandard (extended) APOT:
1) Any 9-1-1 ambulance has an expected offload time greater than 100 minutes.
2. Specialty Diversion may be initiated when specialty care medical equipment or personnel are
not currently available.

3. Internal Disaster Diversion may be initiated for structural failures, infrastructure disruptions,
or health and safety threats
C. Changing Diversion
1. It shall be the responsibility of all hospitals to indicate and maintain their current availability
and diversion status in LEMSIS Resource Bridge.
2. The CoSD EMS Duty Officer may initiate ED Diversion for ED saturation, or APOT exceeds
100 minutes.
a. Within the first hour of initiating ED Diversion, the CoSD EMS Duty Officer shall:
1) Document the reason for a hospital's ED Diversion.
2) Notify the hospital's ED.
b. For EMS Duty Officer-initiated ED Diversion, the hospital shall consult the Duty Officer
before changing ED Diversion status.
D. To request an extension of ED Diversion beyond 4 hours, the hospital must contact the CoSD
EMS Duty Officer.
1. The requesting hospital will provide reason(s) for the continued Diversion and an estimate
on the expected time of ending diversion status. The CoSD EMS Duty Officer may approve
or reject the request.
2. Communication shall be made with the CoSD EMS Duty Officer every 4 hours while on
Diversion
E. Base Hospital Direction of Ambulance Destination for ED Patients:
When the requested ambulance receiving facility is on Diversion, the Base Hospital MICN
determines hospital destination. Destination decisions shall take the following requirements into
account:
Priority 1: Avoid hospitals on Internal Disaster Diversion.
Priority 2: Patient's immediate medical need for a specific facility (e.g., specialty equipment,
left ventricular assist device [LVAD], recent surgery/admission).
1) If a patient has trauma, STEMI, stroke, or another specialty status, avoid hospitals on
that respective Specialty Diversion.
Priority 3: Avoid hospitals on ED Diversion.
1) Hospitals on ED Diversion shall accept patients with uncontrollable life-threatening
problems (See ED Diversion definition).
2) ED Diversion may not be honored if there are no open/available hospitals within an
additional 30-minute travel time.
Priority 4: Patient's request for a specific facility/medical home.
