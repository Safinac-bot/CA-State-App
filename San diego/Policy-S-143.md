• Monitor blood glucose PRN
• Monitor/ECG
• IV/IO Ⓐ
• Capnography
Suspected sepsis
If history suggestive of infection with ≥2 of the following1:
1. Temperature ≥100.4 °F (38.0 °C) or <96.8 °F (36.0 °C)
2. HR ≥90
3. RR ≥20 or EtCO2 <25 mmHg
4. Altered LOC
5. SBP <90 mmHg
• 500 mL fluid bolus IV/IO regardless of initial BP or lung
sounds Ⓐ
• If no rales or SBP <90 mmHg, give additional 500 mL
fluid bolus IV/IO, MR x2 Ⓐ
SBP <90 mmHg after fluid boluses
• Push-dose epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg/mL)
1 mL IV/IO, MR q3 min, titrate to SBP ≥90 mmHg
Push-dose epinephrine mixing instructions
1. Remove 1 mL normal saline (NS) from the 10
mL NS syringe
2. Add 1 mL of epinephrine 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL)
