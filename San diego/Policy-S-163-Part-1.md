PEDIATRIC TREATMENT PROTOCOL S-163
CPR / ARRHYTHMIAS - PART 1 OF 3
Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 3
BLS ALS
• Compression rate 100-120/min
• Ventilation rate (compression-to-ventilation
ratio)
• Neonate: 20-30/min (3:1)
• Pediatric: 10-12/min (15:2)*
• Use metronome or other real-time audiovisual
feedback device
• Rotate compressor at least every 2 min
• Use mechanical compression device, if sizeappropriate available
• O2 and/or ventilate with BVM
• Monitor O2 saturation
• Apply AED during CPR and analyze as soon
as ready
VAD
• Perform CPR
• Contact BH for additional instructions
TAH
• Contact BH for instructions
• Apply defibrillator pads during CPR. Defibrillate
immediately for VF/pulseless VT.
• IV/IO Ⓐ
• Capnography with waveform and value
• NG/OG tube PRN
Team leader priorities
• Monitor CPR quality, rate, depth, full chest recoil,
and capnography value and waveform
• Minimize interruption of compressions (<5 sec)
during ECG rhythm checks
• Charge monitor prior to rhythm checks. Do not
interrupt CPR while charging.
VAD/TAH
• See Adjunct Cardiac Devices section
Capnography
• If EtCO2 rises rapidly during CPR, pause CPR and
check for pulse
Specific protocols (see below)
• Arrhythmias
• Unstable bradycardia
• Supraventricular tachycardia
• Ventricular tachycardia
• Ventricular fibrillation / pulseless VT
• Pulseless electrical activity / asystole
• Return of Spontaneous Circulation
• Adjunct Cardiac Devices
*Continuous compressions are an acceptable alternative for pediatric CPR
