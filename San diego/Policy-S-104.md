Spinal Motion Restriction:
-The use of an appropriately sized cervical collar on a stretcher while
limiting the movement of the spine and maintaining "neutral" in-line
position.
-Backboards should be limited to extrication whenever possible. In-line
stabilization should be maintained with the patient supine and neutral on
the gurney during transport.
-If a patient is not able to tolerate the supine position during transport,
document the reason and communicate to receiving hospital staff.
Sports Injury Patient
If a patient is helmeted and/or shoulder padded, patient helmet and pads
should be removed while on scene.
Document a neurological examination including:
• Test of sensation and abnormal sensation (paresthesia) in all 4
extremities • Test of motor skills in all 4 extremities with active movements by

Pediatrics Patients and Car Seats
Infants restrained in a rear-facing car seat may be immobilized and
extricated in the car seat. The child may remain in the car seat if the
immobilization is secure and his/her condition allows (no signs of
respiratory distress or shock).
Children restrained in a car seat (with a high back) may be immobilized
and extricated in the car seat; however, once removed from the vehicle, the
child should be placed in spinal immobilization.
Children restrained in a booster seat (without a back) need to be
extricated and immobilized following standard spinal immobilization
procedures.
