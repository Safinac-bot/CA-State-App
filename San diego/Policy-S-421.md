IV. POLICY
A. When determining the most appropriate destination, the emergency medical needs of the
patient take priority. When possible, consider facilitating transport to a designated Sexual
Assault Response Team (SART) Center.
B. Assessment, care, and evidence collection for the sexual assault patient:
1. During patient assessment and care, EMS providers may help maintain evidence collection
in coordination with law enforcement. Patient belongings should be transferred to the
receiving facility as possible evidence, and any possible evidence should be documented in
the patient chart. The following may be considered:
a. When cutting clothes, stay at least six inches away from holes, tears, and soiled areas
b. Avoid excessive handling of articles that contain body fluids
c. Retain all equipment and supplies used in treatment such as bandages, sheets, body
fluids such as emesis or tissues that may contain mucous
d. Bag items separately to avoid cross-contamination.
C. Destination considerations for sexual assault patients:
1. If based on EMS patient assessment there are no suspected injuries requiring emergency
medical care and the patient consents to a medical forensic exam, the patient may be
released to Law Enforcement. Law enforcement personnel are highly encouraged to
transport these patients to a designated SART Center. EMS personnel should document the
name of the jurisdictional law enforcement agency.
2. If it is determined by EMS that the sexual assault patient does have an emergency medical
condition the patient should be transported to the most accessible and appropriate facility
staffed, equipped, and prepared to administer care appropriate to the needs of the patient.
3. Transfer of care to the receiving facility should include the report of suspected sexual assault
so that the facility can immediately implement their specific care for such patients. This
includes the reporting requirement to law enforcement and for contacting SART.
