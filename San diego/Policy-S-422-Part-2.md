Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 1
IV. PROCEDURES
A. Restraint equipment applied by prehospital personnel must be either padded leather restraints
or soft restraints (i.e., vest, Velcro, or seatbelt type). The method of restraint must provide for
quick release.
B. The following forms of restraint shall not be applied by EMS prehospital care personnel:
1. Any restraint device requiring a key to remove
2. Backboard, stretcher, or flat used as a "sandwich" restraint
3. Devices that restrain a patient's hand(s), foot, and/or feet behind the patient
4. Methods or materials applied in a manner that could cause vascular or neurological damage
to the patient
5. Hard plastic ties (flex-cuffs) - Aeromedical personnel only may use hard plastic restraints
provided that appropriate agency policies regarding the application and monitoring of the
extremities restrained and the use of alternate restraint methods (such as pharmaceutical
restraints) are in place.
C. Avoid the prone position whenever possible. As soon as possible after the patient is restrained,
they will be repositioned onto their side or supine. If necessary, one arm may be placed above
the head and the other arm to the side. The patient's legs should be restrained at the ankles in
the extended position. Prehospital personnel should ensure that the patient's position does not
compromise the patient's airway, or compromise the neurological or circulatory system, or does
not preclude any necessary medical intervention to protect the patient's airway should vomiting
occur.
D. Restrained extremities shall be evaluated for pulse, movement, sensation, and color at least
every 15 minutes. The results of each evaluation shall be documented in the PPR.
