1 NTG is contraindicated in patients who have taken erectile dysfunction medications such as sildenafil (Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), and vardenafil
(Levitra®) within 48 hours; and pulmonary hypertension medications such as sildenafil (Revatio®), and epoprostenol sodium (Flolan®) and (Veletri®) 2
Do not delay transport for a repeat 12-lead ECG 3 Immediately transmit 12-lead ECG to receiving hospital for suspected STEMI patients regardless of patient presentation 4 Administer aspirin even if discomfort/pain has resolved. If aspirin is not given, document the reason 5 Aspirin may be withheld if an equivalent dose has been administered by a healthcare professional
• Ensure patent airway
• O2 saturation PRN
• Use supplemental O2 to maintain saturation at 94-98%
• O2 and/or ventilate PRN
• Minimize patient exertion, including walking, when
possible
• If SBP >100 mmHg, may assist patient to selfmedicate own prescribed NTG1 SL (maximum 3
doses, including those the patient has taken)
• May assist with placement of 12-lead ECG leads
• May assist patient to self-medicate own prescribed
aspirin up to a max dose of 325 mg
• Monitor/ECG
• IV Ⓐ
• Obtain 12-lead ECG
• Repeat 12-lead ECG after arrhythmia conversion or
any change in patient condition2
• If STEMI suspected, immediately notify BH, transmit
12-lead ECG to appropriate STEMI receiving center
and transport3
• Report LBBB, RBBB or poor-quality ECG
• Aspirin 324 mg chewable PO4,5 Ⓐ
If SBP ≥100 mmHg
• NTG1 0.4 mg SL, MR q3-5 min Ⓐ
• Treat pain with opioids per Pain Management
Protocol (S-141)
Discomfort/pain of suspected cardiac origin with
associated shock
• 250 mL fluid bolus IV/IO with no rales, MR to maintain
SBP ≥90 mmHg Ⓐ
If BP refractory to second fluid bolus
• Push-dose epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg/mL) 1 mL
IV/IO, MR q3 min, titrate to SBP ≥90 mmHg
Push-dose epinephrine mixing instructions
1. Remove 1 mL normal saline (NS) from the 10
mL NS syringe
2. Add 1 mL of epinephrine 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL)
to 9 mL NS syringe
The mixture now has 10 mL of epinephrine at 0.01
mg/mL (10 mcg/mL) concentration.
