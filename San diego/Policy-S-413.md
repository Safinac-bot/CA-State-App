TRIAGE, MULTIPLE/MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS,
ANNEX D
Date: 7/1/2019 Page 1 of 2

I. PURPOSE

To establish guidelines for management, transportation of casualties, and communication for a
Multi or Mass Casualty Incident (MCI).
II. AUTHORITY: California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Sections 1797.204, 1797.220,
1798.2, 1798.6(c), and 1798.170.

III. DEFINITION(S)
Annex D: In San Diego County Annex D is the Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) Operations Annex
of the Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). The term Annex D is also used synonymously as the
declaration of a mass casualty incident. The Annex is intended to assist and direct any agency that
is confronted with any incident that results in enough patients that would strain or overwhelm the
responding agency as determined by the Incident Commander (IC). The activation of an Annex D
emergency allows the emergency resources of the County to be mobilized at the necessary level
to support the incident.
Multi or Mass Casualty Incident (MCI): An incident with sufficient casualties such that field scene
command (Incident Command System) with a medical care branch is established.

IV. PROCEDURES
A. Early notification to the facilitating base hospital is paramount to successful management of
MCIs. While en route, responding units and the primary dispatch center shall make this
notification upon the earliest recognition of a potential MCI.
B. Only one (1) base hospital (facilitating base) will be contacted during the entire incident.
C. One person (MEDCOM) will assume responsibility for all scene medical communication.
MEDCOM should be assigned as early as possible and provide the facilitating base with a brief
size-up* early.

D. Prehospital providers will utilize a nationally recognized triage system (e.g., Simple Triage and
Rapid Treatment (START) or JumpSTART for pediatric patients) and use triage ribbon to
indicate patient category. Treatment tags may be documented if time allows or transport is
delayed.
E. Patient/Problem oriented information should be provided to facilitating base. The size, scope,
and speed of the incident will determine how much patient information can be conveyed by
MEDCOM, the priority elements of the MCI patient report:
1. Patient number if assigned (i.e., #1, #2...)
2. Triage color (RED/Immediate, YELLOW/Delayed, GREEN/Minor)
3. Transporting unit
4. Destination and ETA
If available:
5. Age (adult or pediatric)
6. Gender
7. Primary impression or pertinent findings
F. Utilize the standard radio report for smaller, isolated multi-casualty incidents when the
responding agency has an adequate amount of resources for the number of patients.
G. Transporting units should not make hospital or base contact, except in those rare cases where
a patient's condition has greatly deteriorated, and additional resources will be required upon
arrival.
*Useful "size-up" information for the facilitating base includes a description of the incident, the
estimated number of potential patients, and the geographic location of the incident. This will
allow the facilitating base to inform nearby hospitals of the possibility of patients arriving by
non-EMS transport (law enforcement, POV.).
