FENTANYL
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC
Classification
• Synthetic opioid, opioid analgesic
Mechanism of Action
• Opioid agonist-analgesic; inhibits ascending pain pathways, thus altering pain perception; increases pain threshold;
produces analgesia, respiratory depression, and sedation.
Indications
• Management of acute pain
• Protocols: S-141, S-173
Contraindications
• Pregnancy with pain from active labor
Adult Dose
• IV: Fentanyl up to 100 mcg IV. MR up to 50 mcg IV
q5 min x2. Maximum total dose 200 mcg IV
• IN: Up to 50 mcg IN q15 min x2. 3rd dose fentanyl up
to 50 mcg IN
Pediatric Dose
• IV:
• <10 kg: Fentanyl IV per drug chart. MR at half
initial IV dose BHO
• ≥10 kg: Fentanyl IV per drug chart. MR at half
initial IV dose
• IN:
• <10 kg: Fentanyl IN per drug chart. MR at initial
IN dose BHO
• ≥10 kg: Fentanyl IN per drug chart. MR at initial
IN dose
Adverse Effects
• Confusion
• Paradoxical excitation
• Delirium
• Sedation/drowsiness
• CNS depression
• Respiratory depression
• Apnea
• Dyspnea
• Dysrhythmias
• Hypotension
• Syncope
• Nausea/vomiting
• Abdominal pain
Notes
• Remember to consider non-pharmacologic pain treatments, e.g., place in position of comfort, apply ice packs/splints
PRN, and verbal reassurance.
• Closely monitor respiratory status (including capnography) after administration.
• An initial dose of 100 mcg IV or 50 mcg IN is well tolerated in most adults.
• In opioid-naive or elderly patients, start with a lower dose. For elderly patients not taking opioids, 25 mcg is
frequently sufficient for pain relief. Consider beginning with 25 mcg and titrating up in increments of 25 mcg to
achieve pain relief without respiratory depression.
• For pediatric patients >36 kg or longer than the LBRT, rather than administering the maximum dose, use weightbased dosing for both initial and repeat doses. It is acceptable to round doses (up or down) to the nearest 5 mcg.

KETAMINE
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC
Classification

Maximum for any IV dose is 30 mg. MR x1 in 15 min
if pain remains moderate or severe.
• IN: 0.5 mg/kg IN (50 mg/mL concentration).
Maximum for any IN dose is 50 mg. MR x1 in 15 min
if pain remains moderate or severe.

NITROGLYCERIN
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC
Classification
• Nitrate, anti-anginal
Mechanism of Action
• Nitrate enters vascular smooth muscle and is converted to nitric oxide leading to vasodilation. Relaxes smooth
muscle via dose-dependent dilation of arterial and venous beds: reduces both preload, afterload, and myocardial
oxygen demand. Also improves coronary collateral circulation. Lowers blood pressure, increases heart rate and
occasionally causes paradoxical bradycardia.

acute pulmonary edema

Contraindications
• Use of erectile dysfunction or pulmonary
hypertension medications within last 48 hours
• Suspected intracranial bleed
Adult Dose
• For discomfort/pain of cardiac origin if SBP ≥100
mmHg, NTG 0.4 mg SL, MR q3-5 min
• For CHF
• If systolic BP ≥100 but <150: NTG 0.4 mg SL, MR
q3-5 min
• If systolic BP ≥150: NTG 0.8 mg SL, MR q3-5 min
Pediatric Dose
• Not indicated for use in pediatrics
Adverse Effects
• Headache
• Dizziness
• Weakness
• Reflex tachycardia
• Syncope
• Hypotension
• Nausea/vomiting
Notes
• EMT: Authorized to assist patient to self-medicate own prescribed NTG only.
• Examples of erectile dysfunction medications include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).
• Examples of pulmonary hypertension medications include sildenafil (Revatio) and epoprostenol sodium (Flolan,
Veletri).
• Nitroglycerin is used primarily to provide pain relief from anginal chest discomfort.
• Assess the patient and document vital signs, including pain scale, before and after each administration.

ONDANSETRON
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC
Classification
• Antiemetic, selective 5-HT3 antagonist
Mechanism of Action
• Mechanism of action unclear; believed to function via serotonin antagonism at central and/or peripheral receptors.

chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area of the medullary structure that controls vomiting. May cause prolongation of
the QT interval.
Indications

• Protocols: S-120, S-139, S-169, S-174
Contraindications
• Known or suspected long QT syndrome
• <6 months of age
Adult Dose
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV/IM/ODT, MR x1 in 10 min
Pediatric Dose
• Ondansetron IV/IM/ODT per drug chart
Adverse Effects
• Headache
• Syncope
• Wheezing

• Hives
• Skin rash
Notes
• ECG changes include dose-dependent QT prolongation and ST-segment depression.

SODIUM BICARBONATE
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC
Classification
• Alkalizing agent, antidote
Mechanism of Action
• Increases blood and urinary pH by neutralizing hydrogen ion concentration.
Indications
• Management of hyperkalemia, tricyclic
antidepressant overdose, and specific crush injuries
• Protocols: S-127, S-131, S-134, S-139, S-163,
S-165, S-169
Contraindications
Adult Dose

Pediatric Dose
• NaHCO3 per drug chart IV/IO
Adverse Effects
• Electrolyte imbalance
• Pulmonary edema (secondary to sodium overload)
• Tremors
• Twitching
• Seizures (caused by alkalosis)
Notes
• Monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of fluid overload. Because the buffering action produces carbon
dioxide, ensure the patient has adequate airway and ventilatory support.
• May precipitate or inactivate other medications; flush the IV line well before and after administering sodium
bicarbonate. For example, precipitates to form calcium carbonate (chalk) when used with calcium chloride.
Administer calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate in separate IV/IO or thoroughly flush in between
administrations using at least 10 mL of normal saline.

TRANEXAMIC ACID
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC
Classification
• Hemostatic agent, antifibrinolytic agent, plasminogen inhibitor
Mechanism of Action

to plasmin (enzyme that halts the clotting process). Increases fibrin formation, which impedes blood flow for the
formation of a clot.
Indications
• Management of trauma-associated hemorrhage and
postpartum hemorrhage
