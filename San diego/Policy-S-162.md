epinephrine auto-injector or albuterol MDI
once only. BH contact required for additional
dose(s)

• <1 month: SBP <60 mmHg
• 1 month – 1 year: SBP <70 mmHg
• 1 year – 10 years:
SBP <70 mmHg + (2x age in years)
• ≥10 years: SBP <90 mmHg
• Monitor/ECG
• IV/IO Ⓐ
• Capnography
Allergic reaction (skin signs only)
• Urticaria (hives, rash)
• Erythema (flushing)
• Pruritus (itching)
Allergic reaction treatment
• Diphenhydramine per drug chart IV/IM
Suspected anaphylaxis reaction
• Respiratory: throat tightness, hoarse voice, wheezing/stridor,
cough, SOB
• Cardiovascular: fainting, dizziness, tachycardia, low BP
• GI: nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping
• Tissues: angioedema of eyelids, lips, tongue, face
Anaphylaxis treatment
• Epinephrine 1:1,000 (1 mg/mL) per drug chart IM (lateral
thigh), MR x2 q5 min Ⓐ then
• Diphenhydramine per drug chart IV/IM
If respiratory involvement1
• Albuterol/Levalbuterol per drug chart via nebulizer, MR Ⓐ
• Ipratropium bromide per drug chart via nebulizer added
to first dose of albuterol/levalbuterol
Respiratory distress with stridor at rest
• Epinephrine 1:1,000 per drug chart (combined with 3 mL
normal saline) via nebulizer, MR x1
Severe anaphylaxis or inadequate response to treatment
• Fluid bolus IV/IO per drug chart MR to maintain adequate
perfusion Ⓐ
• Push-dose epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg/mL)
per drug chart IV/IO, MR q3 min, titrate to adequate perfusion
or improvement in status
Push-dose epinephrine mixing instructions
1. Remove 1 mL normal saline (NS) from the 10
mL NS syringe
1 Infection control: If concerned about aerosolized infectious exposure, substitute with MDI, if available
