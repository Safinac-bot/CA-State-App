STROKE AND TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK
Date: 7/1/2024 Page 1 of 2
BLS ALS
For patients with symptoms suggestive of TIA or stroke with
onset of symptoms known to be <24 hours in duration
• Maintain O2 saturation at 94% to 98%
• Keep head of bed (HOB) at 15° elevation. If SBP <120 mmHg and
patient tolerates, place HOB flat.
• Expedite transport
• Make BH initial notification early to confirm destination
• Notify accepting Stroke Receiving Center of potential stroke code
patient enroute
• Provide list of all current medications, especially anticoagulants,
upon arrival toEmergency Department
Important signs/symptoms to recognize, report, and document
Use BE-FAST Prehospital Stroke Screening Scale in assessment of
possible TIA or stroke patients
B = Balance: Unsteadiness, ataxia
E = Eyes: Blurred/double or loss of vision
F = Face: Unilateral face droop
A = Arms and/or legs: Unilateral weakness exhibited
 by a drift or drop
S = Speech: Slurred, inability to find words, absent
T = Time: Accurate last known well time
If BE-FAST is positive, calculate and report the FAST-ED Prehospital
Stroke Severity Scale value
F = Facial palsy
A = Arm weakness
S = Speech changes
T = Time
E = Eye deviation
D = Denial/Neglect
• Sudden severe headache with no known cause
• Get specific last known well time in military time (hours: minutes)
Bring witness to ED to verify time of symptom onset and
provide consent for interventions. If witness unable to ride in
ambulance, obtain accurate contact phone number.
Obtain blood glucose. If blood glucose <60 mg/dL, treat for
hypoglycemia.
• If patient is awake and able to swallow, give 3 oral glucose tabs or
paste (15 gm total)
• Patient may eat or drink, if able
• If patient is unconscious, NPO
• IV Ⓐ (large-bore antecubital site
preferred)
• 250 mL fluid bolus IV/IO to maintain BP
≥120 mmHg if no rales, MR Ⓐ
