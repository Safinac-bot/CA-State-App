COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE
Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 2

I. PURPOSE

A. To ensure EMS patient delivery to a receiving facility is anticipated, announced, and
coordinated prior to arrival.
B. To record geographic areas with weak radio or cellular signal.
C. To document treatments provided during a period of communications failure.
D. To provide a communication failure reporting methodology.
E. To provide a method to improve communications reliability.
II. AUTHORITY: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Sections 1797 and 1798.2; and California
Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 3.3, Section 100091.02.

III. DEFINITION(S)
Communications Failure: A situation where EMS clinicians are unable to contact a base hospital
because of radio or cellular signal weakness, equipment failure (e.g., battery failed, antenna
broken), inability to access the radio system with a 'system busy' tone or message, or inability to
maintain understandable voice contact.
IV. POLICY
A. In the event that an EMS clinician at the scene of an emergency attempts direct voice contact
with a Base Hospital but cannot establish or maintain that contact and reasonably determines
that a delay in treatment may jeopardize the patient, the EMS clinician may perform any adult
or pediatric protocols listed as Standing Orders (SO) or Base Hospital Orders (BHO) within the
approved County of San Diego EMS protocols. The EMS clinician may continue treatment
within the protocols, listed as SO or BHO, until direct communication can be established and
maintained, or until the patient arrives at the receiving facility. Direct voice communication with
a Base Hospital shall be reattempted at the scene or in route. Communication failure shall not
be declared for routine busy radio traffic periods, without reasonable attempts to contact more
than one Base Hospital.

2. Use a cellular phone to contact a base hospital
3. Request that the assigned communications center contact a base hospital to relay patient
acuity and destination
4. Contact the receiving hospital via the BLS/MT1 zones on the Regional Communications
System (RCS) network
5. Agencies using LEMSIS shall upload the prehospital care record (PCR) to the receiving
facility prior to arrival
