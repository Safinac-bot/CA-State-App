Date: 7/1/2019 Page 1 of 2
8. A "Final Attestation for an Aid-in-Dying Drug to End My Life in a Humane and Dignified
Manner". However, there is no mandate for the patient to maintain the final attestation in
close proximity to the patient. If a copy of the final attestation is available, EMS personnel
should confirm the patient is the person named in the final attestation. EMS personnel should
make a good faith effort to review and verify: Patient's name, signature, and dated document
identified as "Final Attestation For An Aid-in-Dying Drug to End My Life in a Humane and
Dignified Manner"
9. The following guidelines are provided for EMS personnel when responding to a patient who
has self- administered an aid-in-dying drug.
a. All patients require an immediate medical evaluation and should be provided comfort
measures (e.g., airway positioning, suctioning).
b. Withhold resuscitative measures if patient is in cardiopulmonary arrest. If a POLST or
Advanced Health Care Directive is present, follow the directive as appropriate for the
clinical situation.
c. The patient may at any time withdraw or rescind his or her request for an aid-in-dying
drug regardless of the patient's mental state. In this instance, EMS personnel shall
provide medical care as per standing protocols and contact the base hospital.
d. Family members may be at the scene of a patient who has self- administered an aid-indying drug. If there is objection to the End of Life Option act, inform the family that comfort
measures (e.g., airway positioning, suction) will be provided and consider base hospital
contact for further direction.
e. Obtain a copy of the final attestation and attach it with the EMS report form when
possible.
B. Documentation
The reason for withholding or terminating CPR shall be documented in the patient care
record. DNR orders shall include the name of the physician or designee (e.g., Physician
Assistant, Nurse Practitioner) and the date of the order. If patient transport is initiated, the DNR
Form (original or copy), DNR Medallion, or a copy of the valid DNR Order from the patient's
medical record shall accompany the patient. If no printed copy is available, note the physician's
name and presence of signature.
C. Considerations
1. In the event any patient expires in an ambulance, either before or during transport, the
following should be considered:
a. Unless specifically requested, the patient should not be returned to a private residence
or skilled nursing facility. Continue to the destination hospital or hospice.
