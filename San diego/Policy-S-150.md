Mild
Miosis, rhinorrhea, increasing salivation
• DuoDote (or equivalent) autoinjector1,2 IM

evaluation, administer additional DuoDote (or equivalent)
autoinjector1,2 IM up to a cumulative maximum of 3 doses
Severe
Severe respiratory distress, respiratory arrest, cyanosis, extreme
SLUDGE/BBB, seizures, unconsciousness
