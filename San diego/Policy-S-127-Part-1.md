CPR / ARRHYTHMIAS - PART 1 OF 3
Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 3
BLS ALS
• Continuous compressions of 100-120/min
with ventilation rate of 10-12/min
• Use metronome or other real-time
audiovisual feedback device
• Rotate compressor at least every 2 min
• Use mechanical compression device (unless
contraindicated)
• O2 and/or ventilate with BVM
• Monitor O2 saturation
• Apply AED during CPR and analyze as soon
as ready
VAD
• Perform CPR
• Contact BH for additional instructions
TAH
• Contact BH for instructions
• Apply defibrillator pads during CPR. Defibrillate
immediately for VF/pulseless VT.
• IV/IO Ⓐ
• Capnography with waveform and value
• ET/PAA without interrupting compressions
• NG/OG tube PRN
• Provide cardiac monitor data to agency QA/QI
department
Team leader priorities
• Monitor CPR quality, rate, depth, full chest
recoil, and capnography value and waveform
• Minimize interruption of compressions (<5 sec)
during ECG rhythm checks
• Charge monitor prior to rhythm checks. Do not
interrupt CPR while charging.
VAD/TAH
• See Adjunct Cardiac Devices section
Capnography
• For EtCO2 >0 mmHg, may place ET/PAA without
interrupting compressions
• If EtCO2 rises rapidly during CPR, pause CPR
and check for pulse
Specific protocols (see below)
• Arrhythmias
• Unstable bradycardia
• Supraventricular tachycardia
• Atrial fibrillation / flutter
• Ventricular tachycardia
• Ventricular fibrillation / pulseless VT
• Pulseless electrical activity / asystole
• Return of Spontaneous Circulation
• Adjunct Cardiac Devices
• Termination of Resuscitation
• Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation

UNSTABLE‡ BRADYCARDIA
* May omit atropine in patients unlikely to have clinical benefit (e.g., heart transplant patients, 2nd degree type II,
or 3rd degree heart block)
‡SBP ˂90 mmHg and exhibiting any of the following signs/symptoms of inadequate perfusion, e.g.,
• Altered mental status (decreased LOC, confusion, agitation)
• Pallor
• Diaphoresis
• Significant chest pain of suspected cardiac origin
• Severe dyspnea
†External cardiac pacing
• Set rate and energy per manufacturer's recommendations
• Increase energy setting until capture occurs, usually between 50 mA and 100 mA
• After electrical and mechanical capture achieved, increase energy by 10%
• If patient remains hypotensive, increase rate in 5 bpm increments (not to exceed 100 bpm) to achieve and
maintain adequate perfusion
• Obtain 12-lead ECG
• Atropine 1 mg IV/IO, MR q3-5 min to max 3 mg*
• If SBP <90 mmHg and rales not present, 250 mL fluid bolus IV/IO, MR Ⓐ
Rhythm unresponsive to atropine
• Midazolam 1-5 mg IV/IO PRN pre-pacing
• External cardiac pacing†
• If capture occurs and SBP ≥100 mmHg, treat per Pain Management Protocol (S-141)
If SBP <90 mmHg after atropine or initiation of pacing
• 250 mL fluid bolus IV/IO, MR x1
• Push-dose epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg/mL) 1 mL IV/IO. MR q3 min, titrate to SBP ≥90 mmHg.
Push-dose epinephrine mixing instructions
1. Remove 1 mL normal saline (NS) from the 10
mL NS syringe
2. Add 1 mL of epinephrine 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL)
to 9 mL NS syringe
The mixture now has 10 mL of epinephrine at 0.01
mg/mL (10 mcg/mL) concentration.

SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA
‡SBP ˂90 mmHg and exhibiting any of the following signs/symptoms of inadequate perfusion, e.g.,
• Altered mental status (decreased LOC, confusion, agitation)
• Pallor
• Diaphoresis
• Significant chest pain of suspected cardiac origin
• Severe dyspnea
• Obtain 12-lead ECG
Stable (symptomatic)
• If SBP <90 mmHg and rales not present, 250 mL fluid bolus IV/IO, MR Ⓐ
• VSM
• Adenosine 6 mg rapid IV/IO followed by 20 mL NS rapid IV/IO
• Adenosine 12 mg rapid IV/IO followed by 20 mL NS rapid IV/IO, MR x1
Unstable‡
• Consider midazolam 1-5 mg IV/IO pre-cardioversion
• Synchronized cardioversion at manufacturer's recommended energy dose, MR x2, MR BHO
• After successful cardioversion
• Check BP. If SBP <90 mmHg and rales not present, 250 mL fluid bolus IV/IO, MR
• Obtain 12-lead ECG
