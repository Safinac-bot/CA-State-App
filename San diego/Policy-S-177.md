BLS ALS
• O2 saturation PRN
• O2 and/or ventilate PRN
• NPO, anticipate vomiting
• Obtain temperature
• If febrile, remove excess clothing
• Monitor blood glucose PRN
Assess for hypotension
• <1 month: SBP <60 mmHg
• 1 month – 1 year: SBP <70 mmHg
• 1 year – 10 years:
SBP <70mm Hg + (2x age in years)
• ≥10 years: SBP <90 mmHg
Assess for altered mental status
• 1 month – 1 year: lethargic or irritable,
limp and flaccid
• 1 year – 10 years: lethargic, change in
baseline per guardian
• Monitor/ECG
• IV/IO Ⓐ
• Capnography
Suspected sepsis
If history suggestive of infection with ≥2 of the following1:
1. Temperature ≥100.4 °F (38.0 °C) or <96.8 °F (36.0 °C)
2. Tachycardia
3. Tachypnea or EtCO2 <25 mmHg
4. Altered LOC
5. Hypotension
6. Weak peripheral pulses
7. Delayed capillary refill
• IV/IO fluid bolus per drug chart regardless of initial BP or
lung sounds Ⓐ
• If no rales or hypotensive for age, give additional IV/IO
fluid bolus per drug chart, MR x2 Ⓐ
Hypotensive for age after fluid boluses
• Push-dose epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg/mL) IV/IO per
drug chart, MR q3 min, titrate to adequate perfusion
Push-dose epinephrine mixing instructions
1. Remove 1 mL normal saline (NS) from the 10 mL
NS syringe
2. Add 1 mL of epinephrine 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL) to
9 mL NS syringe
The mixture now has 10 mL of epinephrine at 0.01
mg/mL (10 mcg/mL) concentration.
1 Suspected sepsis should be reported to the Base Hospital and upon transfer of care at the receiving hospital.
