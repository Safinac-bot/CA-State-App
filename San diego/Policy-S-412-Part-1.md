a prehospital system.
IV. POLICY
A. All emergency patients will be offered treatment and/or transport following a complete
assessment.
B. AMAs
1. Adults have the right to accept or refuse any and all prehospital care and transportation
provided that the decision to accept or refuse these treatments and transportation is made
on an informed basis and provided that these adults have the mental capacity to make and
understand the implications of such a decision.
2. The decisions of a DDM shall be treated as though the patient was making these decisions
for him/herself.
3. For those emergency patients who meet Base Hospital contact criteria (see County of San
Diego, Emergency Medical Service (CoSD EMS) Policy S-415 "Base Hospital
Contact/Patient Transportation and Report") and wish to sign AMA, prehospital personnel
shall use their best efforts to make Base Hospital contact prior to the patient leaving the
scene and prior to the responding unit leaving the scene. In the event that the patient leaves
the scene prior to Base Hospital contact, field personnel shall still contact the Base Hospital
for quality improvement and trending purposes only.
4. The Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Advanced EMT (AEMT), or Paramedic should
contact the Base Hospital and involve the Mobile Intensive Care Nurse (MICN) and/or Base
Hospital Physician (BHP) in any situation in which the treatment or transport refusal is
deemed life-threatening or "high risk" by the EMT, AEMT, or Paramedic.

b. All circumstances pertaining to consent issues during a patient encounter

drugs
d. The ability of the patient/DDM to comprehend and demonstrate an understanding of
his/her illness or injury

verbalize understanding of this information
f. The reasons for the AMA, the alternate plan, if any, of the patient/DDM and the presence
of any on scene support system (family, neighbor, or friend (state which))
g. That the patient/DDM has been informed that they may re-access 9-1-1 if necessary
h. The signature of the patient/DDM on the AMA form, or, if the prehospital personnel are
unable to have an AMA form signed, the reason why a signed form was not obtained
