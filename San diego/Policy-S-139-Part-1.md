BLS ALS
• Ensure patent airway
• Protect C-spine
• Control obvious bleeding
• Spinal motion restriction per Skills List (S-104)
except in penetrating trauma without
neurological deficits
• O2 saturation. Maintain SpO2 at 94% to 98%
• O2 and/or ventilate at a rate of 10/min PRN
• Keep warm
• Hemostatic gauze
Abdominal trauma
• Cover eviscerated bowel with saline pads
Chest trauma
• Cover open chest wound with three-sided
occlusive dressing. Release dressing if
tension pneumothorax develops.
• Chest seal PRN
Extremity trauma
• Splint neurologically stable fractures in
position as presented. Traction splint PRN.
• Reduce grossly angulated long bone fractures
with no pulse or sensation PRN
• Direct pressure to control external
hemorrhage
• Apply gauze or hemostatic dressing PRN
• Tourniquet PRN
• In MCI, direct pressure not required prior to
tourniquet application
Impaled objects
• Immobilize and leave impaled objects in place
• Remove object impaled in face, cheek, or
neck if there is total airway obstruction
Any suspicion of neurological injury
(mechanism, GCS, examination)
• High-flow O2 PRN
• Monitor SpO2, BP, and HR q3-5 min
• If SpO2 <90% or hypoventilation (despite highflow O2), assist ventilations with BVM
• Monitor/ECG
• IV/IO Ⓐ
• Capnography. Maintain EtCO2 35-45 mmHg PRN
• Treat pain per Pain Management Protocol (S-141)
SBP <90 mmHg or signs of shock
• 500 mL fluid bolus IV/IO, MR x3 q15 min to maintain
SBP ≥90 mmHg Ⓐ
Trauma-associated hemorrhage <3 hours prior and at
least one of the following:
1. SBP <90 mmHG
2. Shock index ≥1.0 (HR ≥ SBP)
3. Uncontrolled external bleeding
• Tranexamic acid 1 gm/10 mL IV/IO, in 50-100 mL NS,
over 10 min
Crush injury requiring extrication with compression of
extremity or torso ≥2 hours
Immediately prior to anticipated release
• 1,000 mL fluid bolus IV/IO Ⓐ
• NaHCO3 1 mEq/kg IV/IO
• CaCl2 1 gm IV/IO over 30 sec
• Continuous albuterol/levalbuterol 6 mL via nebulizer Ⓐ
Grossly angulated long bone fractures
• Reduce with gentle unidirectional traction for splinting Ⓐ
Severe respiratory distress with diminished or absent
breath sounds (unilaterally or bilaterally), and SBP <90
mmHg, and suspected pneumothorax
• Needle thoracostomy
For nausea or vomiting
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV/IM/ODT, MR x1 in 10 min
For traumatic cardiac arrest
• 1,000 mL fluid bolus IV/IO Ⓐ
• Do not administer epinephrine

patient to the left 30°
Transportation and Destination Guidelines
Pediatric patients who meet criteria outlined in T-460 (Identification of the Pediatric Trauma Center Patient)
should be transported to the Designated Pediatric Trauma Center, except in the following situations.
1. Adult with child
a. If there is a single ambulance (air/ground) with both a pediatric trauma center patient and an adult
trauma center patient, the ambulance should first transport the more critical patient to the appropriate
facility. If both patients are critical, or if there are other questions, both may be transported to the
designated adult trauma center.
b. Field personnel should consider splitting the team using additional ALS transport vehicles, or
aeromedical resources to transport the pediatric patient to the pediatric trauma facility and the adult
patient to the catchment area trauma facility.
2. Trauma center diversion
The pediatric patient who is identified as a trauma patient shall be transported to the designated pediatric
trauma center. When the pediatric trauma center is on diversion, including age-specific diversion, the
pediatric patient shall be transported to the county-designated backup pediatric trauma center, the
University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
3. Pregnant pediatric patient
A pediatric pregnant trauma patient shall be transported to UCSD.
