• Midazolam† 5 mg IM/IN/IV, MR x1 in 5-10 min
• 500 mL fluid bolus IV/IO PRN, MR x1, MR BHO Ⓐ
*Taser barb considerations
• Taser discharge for simple behavioral control is usually benign and does not require transport to BEF
for evaluation.
• Patients who are injured; appear to be under the influence of drugs; or present with altered mental
status or symptoms of illness should have medical evaluation performed by EMS personnel before
being transported to BEF.
• If barbs are impaled in anatomically sensitive location such as eye, face, neck, finger/hand, or
genitalia, do not remove the barb. Transport patient to BEF.
†For severely agitated or combative patients, IN or IM midazolam is the preferred route to decrease risk of
injury to the patient and personnel.
Alert: Co-administration of midazolam in patients with alcohol intoxication can cause respiratory
depression. Consider avoiding or reducing midazolam dose.
