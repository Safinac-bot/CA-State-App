TRAUMA - PART 1 OF 2
Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 2
BLS ALS
• Ensure patent airway
• Protect C-spine
• Control obvious bleeding
• Spinal motion restriction per Skills List (S-104)
except in penetrating trauma without
neurological deficits
• O2 saturation. Maintain SpO2 ≥90%.
• O2 and/or ventilate PRN
• Keep warm
• Hemostatic gauze
Abdominal trauma
• Cover eviscerated bowel with saline pads
Chest trauma
• Cover open chest wound with three-sided
occlusive dressing. Release dressing if tension
pneumothorax develops.
• Chest seal PRN
Extremity trauma
• Splint neurologically stable fractures in position
as presented. Traction splint PRN.
• Reduce grossly angulated long bone fractures
with no pulse or sensation PRN
• Direct pressure to control external hemorrhage
• Apply gauze or hemostatic dressing PRN
• Tourniquet PRN
• In MCI, direct pressure not required prior to
tourniquet application
Impaled objects
• Immobilize and leave impaled objects in place
• Remove object impaled in face, cheek, or neck if
there is total airway obstruction
Any suspicion of neurological injury
(mechanism, GCS, examination)
• High-flow O2 PRN
• Monitor SpO2, BP, and HR q3-5 min
• If SpO2 <90% or inadequate respirations
(despite high-flow O2), assist ventilations with
BVM
• Monitor/ECG
• IV/IO Ⓐ
• Capnography. Maintain EtCO2 35-45 mmHg PRN
• Treat pain per Pain Management Protocol (S-173)
Signs of shock or hypotensive for age
• Fluid bolus IV/IO per drug chart, MR x3 q15 min to
maintain adequate perfusion Ⓐ
Crush injury requiring extrication with compression
of extremity or torso ≥2 hours
Immediately prior to anticipated release
• IV/IO fluid bolus per drug chart, MR BHPO Ⓐ
• NaHCO3 IV/IO per drug chart
• CaCl2 IV/IO over 30 sec per drug chart, MR x1 in 5
min for continued ECG findings consistent with
hyperkalemia
• Continuous albuterol/levalbuterol per drug chart via
nebulizer
Grossly angulated long bone fractures
• Reduce with gentle unidirectional traction for
splinting Ⓐ
Severe respiratory distress with diminished or
absent breath sounds (unilaterally or bilaterally),
and hypotensive for age, and suspected
pneumothorax
• Needle thoracostomy
For nausea or vomiting
≥6 months
• Ondansetron IV/IM/ODT per drug chart
For traumatic cardiac arrest
• IV/IO fluid bolus per drug chart Ⓐ
• Do not administer epinephrine

Pregnancy ≥6 months
• If spinal motion restriction indicated, tilt patient
to the left 30°
Hypotension by age
• <1 month: SBP <60 mmHg
• 1 month – 1 year: SBP <70 mmHg
• 1 year – 10 years: SBP <70 mmHg + (2x age in years)
• ≥10 years: SBP <90 mmHg
Transportation and Destination Guidelines
Pediatric patients who meet criteria outlined in T-460 (Identification of the Pediatric Trauma Center Patient) should be
transported to the Designated Pediatric Trauma Center, except in the following situations.
1. Adult with child
a. If there is a single ambulance (air/ground) with both a pediatric trauma center patient and an adult trauma center
patient, the ambulance should first transport the more critical patient to the appropriate facility. If both patients are
critical, or if there are other questions, both may be transported to the designated adult trauma center.
b. Field personnel should consider splitting the team using additional ALS transport vehicles, or aeromedical
resources to transport the pediatric patient to the pediatric trauma facility and the adult patient to the catchment
area trauma facility.
2. Trauma center diversion
The pediatric patient who is identified as a trauma patient shall be transported to the designated pediatric trauma
center. When the pediatric trauma center is on diversion, including age-specific diversion, the pediatric patient shall
be transported to the county-designated backup pediatric trauma center, the University of California, San Diego
(UCSD).
3. Pregnant pediatric patient
A pediatric pregnant trauma patient shall be transported to UCSD.
