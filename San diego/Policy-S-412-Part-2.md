PREHOSPITAL TREATMENT AND
TRANSPORTATION OF ADULTS – REFUSAL OF
CARE OR SUGGESTED DESTINATION, RELEASE - PART 2 OF 2
Date: 7/1/2025 Page 1 of 2
C. Patient Refusal of Transport to Recommended Facility
Should the situation arise wherein a patient refuses transport to what is determined by the Base
Hospital to be the most accessible emergency facility equipped, staffed, and prepared to
administer care appropriate to the needs of the patient but the patient requests transport to an
alternate facility:
1. Field personnel should discuss with the Base Hospital that patient's or DDM's rationale for
their choice of that alternate facility.
2. Inform the patient/DDM of Base Hospital's rationale for its selected destination.
3. If the patient still refuses transport to the selected destination, follow procedures for the
patient to refuse treatment and/or transport AMA. However, if, in the judgment of the Base
Hospital, the patient's refusal of transport would create a life-threatening or high-risk
situation, and the patient continues to refuse the recommended destination, document the
AMA and transport the patient to the requested facility if possible.
4. Arrange for alternate means of transportation to the facility of choice, if appropriate.
D. Patient-Centered Care Modification
1. Paramedics shall perform a patient assessment and complete a Base Hospital report (as
required per CoSD EMS Policy S-415 "Base Hospital Contact/Patient Transportation and
Report") prior to initiating a PCCM.
2. EMS clinicians shall complete a PCR with documentation of criteria in CoSD EMS Protocol
S-100.2 for all incidents where a PCCM was applied.
3. Patients meeting criteria in CoSD EMS Protocol S-100.2 shall be transported with an ALS
level of care, unless a specified exception criteria is met.
4. EMS clinicians shall complete a PCR with documentation of criteria in CoSD EMS Protocol
S-100.2 for all patients that are transported by BLS level of care when ALS criteria were met.
5. If a patient's condition deteriorates during BLS transport, the EMT shall contact a Base
Hospital for direction on destination and inform them that a PCCM was applied. The Base
Hospital shall generate a report to the Prehospital Audit Committee documenting the
incident.
6. All PCCMs shall be reviewed by the agency's internal Quality Improvement program.

E. Release
If the patient and EMS personnel (including the Base Hospital, if a base was contacted) agree
that the illness/injury does not require immediate treatment/transport via emergency/9-1-1
services, and the patient does not require the services of the prehospital system, the patient
may be released at scene. For those patients who meet Base Hospital contact criteria (see
CoSD EMS Policy S-415 "Base Hospital Contact/Patient Transportation and Report"), field
personnel shall attempt to contact the base prior to the patient leaving the scene.
