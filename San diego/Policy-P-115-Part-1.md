ACTIVATED CHARCOAL
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC
Class
• Antidote
Mechanism of Action
• Adsorbs a variety of drugs and chemicals (e.g., physical binding of a molecule to the surface of charcoal particles);
desorption of bound particles may occur unless the ratio of charcoal to toxin is extremely high.

ADENOSINE
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC
Classification
• Antidysrhythmic
Mechanism of Action
• Slows conduction through the AV node and interrupts AV reentry pathways as well as conduction through the SA
nodes.
Indications
• Management of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)
• Protocols: S-127, S-163
Contraindications
• Second- or third-degree AV block (without
pacemaker)
• Sick sinus syndrome
Adult Dose
• Adenosine 6 mg rapid IV/IO followed by 20 mL NS
rapid IV/IO
• If no conversion, adenosine 12 mg rapid IV/IO
followed by 20 mL NS rapid IV/IO, MR x1
Pediatric Dose
• Adenosine per drug chart rapid IV/IO, followed with
20 mL NS rapid IV/IO, MR x2
Adverse Effects
• Flushing
• Sweating
• Dizziness
• Nervousness
• Hypotension
• Feeling of impending doom
• Severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma
• Paresthesia
Notes
• For stable patients, use Valsalva maneuver prior to administration. Discontinue Valsalva maneuver after 5-10
seconds if no conversion.
• Ideally, cannulate a proximal vein with an 18-20g catheter. Use the IV port closest to the patient and rapidly flush
with 20mL normal saline immediately.
• Run a 6-second ECG strip before, during, and after drug administration.
• Patients frequently have a brief period of escape beats or asystole before the sinus node starts up again. This may
be perceived as a feeling of impending death and can be extremely frightening for patients.
• If the wide-complex tachycardia is ventricular in origin, adenosine is highly unlikely to result in cardioversion.
• Bronchospasm may occur in patients with a history of airway disease, such as asthma or COPD.

albuterol.
Indications
• Management of respiratory distress (non-cardiac,
anaphylaxis, and burns), suspected hyperkalemia,
and specific crush injuries

Notes
• Ineffective in croup and should be avoided.
• Pediatric patients between 2-6 years of age may be more prone to adverse effects.
• Do not assume patients have administered their own drug properly. Do not include home doses of
albuterol/levalbuterol in your total drug administration consideration.
• If concerned about aerosolized infectious exposure, substitute with MDI, if available.
• Patients may need to be instructed on proper use of the MDI.
• Levalbuterol may be substituted for albuterol and can be combined with ipratropium bromide. This substitution
option applies to patients ≥6 years of age.

Notes
• May omit atropine in bradycardic patients unlikely to have clinical benefit (e.g., heart transplant patients, seconddegree type II, or third-degree heart block).
• Use cautiously if myocardial infarction or ischemia is suspected, as atropine will increase myocardial oxygen
demand, which may worsen the infarct.
• In organophosphate poisoning, titrate atropine to SLUDGE/BBB signs/symptoms, not to tachycardia. Cardiac
monitoring should be considered in all cases of severe organophosphate poisoning.

• Immediately stop administration if extravasation occurs; document it and notify the receiving facility staff.
• Do not administer to patients with stroke unless hypoglycemia is documented.
• Repeat blood glucose level is required if patient remains on scene (AMA or release) and initial blood glucose level
was abnormal.

EPINEPHRINE (1:1,000)
EMT L AEMT PARAMEDIC
Classification
• Alpha/beta adrenergic agonist
Mechanism of Action
• A naturally occurring catecholamine that acts directly on alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. It is the most potent
activator of alpha receptors, vasoconstricting the aorta and peripheral vasculature. Beta-1 stimulation increases
inotropy, chronotropy, and AV conduction. Beta-2 stimulation causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and
vasodilation to internal organs and skeletal muscles.
Indications
• Management of anaphylaxis, severe respiratory
distress/failure, and stridor in pediatrics
• Protocols: S-122, S-136, S-162, S-167, S-170

mL normal saline) via nebulizer, MR x1
Adverse Effects
• Nervousness/restlessness
• Headache
• Chest pain
• Tremors
• Dysrhythmias
• Nausea/vomiting
• Hypertension
• Palpitations
Notes
• EMT: Authorized to administer via auto-injector only.
• Epinephrine is the most important immediate treatment for anaphylaxis and should be administered as soon as
anaphylaxis is recognized. The pharmacologic actions address the pathophysiologic changes that occur in
anaphylaxis better than any other medication. Delayed epinephrine injection is associated with fatalities.
• Inadvertent IV injection of usual IM formulation and dose constitutes a 10-fold overdose that can result in sudden
and severe hypertension and cerebral hemorrhage.
• In patients who remain hypotensive after initial IM epinephrine, administer IV fluids. Have push-dose epinephrine
ready for patients unresponsive to repeated IM epinephrine and IV fluids.
