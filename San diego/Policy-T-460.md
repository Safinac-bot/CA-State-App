IDENTIFICATION OF THE TRAUMA CENTER
PATIENT
Date: 7/1/2018 Page 1 of 2

I. PURPOSE

To establish criteria for identification of trauma center patients to be transported to a designated
trauma center
II. AUTHORITY: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Sections 1798, 1798.102, and 1798.163.

III. DEFINITION(S)
Adult: Any trauma patient known, or appearing to be, 15 years of age or older.
Pediatric: Any trauma patient known, or appearing to be, 14 years of age or less.
IV. POLICY
A. The Base Hospital Physician/Mobile Intensive Care Nurse (MICN) shall use the criteria in
attachment T-460A to identify patients requiring transport to a trauma center. Criteria consists
of four categories:
1. Abnormal vital signs/altered level of consciousness
2. Meeting anatomic injury criteria
3. Meeting mechanism of injury criteria
4. Special patient or system considerations
B. Transportation
1. The adult patient who is identified as a trauma patient will be transported to the most
appropriate designated adult trauma center.
2. The pediatric patient who is identified as a trauma patient will be transported to the
designated pediatric trauma center (Rady Children's).
3. When at a scene with both pediatric and adult trauma patients, when resources are
available, transport the pediatric trauma patients to the designated trauma facility (Rady
Children's) and the adult trauma patient to the catchment area trauma facility.
4. For a single ambulance (air/ground) with both a pediatric and an adult trauma patient:

a. If the pediatric patient is more critical, first transport that patient to Rady Children's
Hospital and then transport the adult patient to Sharp Memorial Hospital.
b. If the adult patient is more critical transport both to the adult catchment area trauma
center.
5. If the designated pediatric trauma center is "on bypass", pediatric trauma patients should be
delivered to the Level 1 adult designated trauma facility (UCSD).
C. Destination
1. The Trauma Decision Tree Algorithm (CoSD EMS Policy T-460A) is a triage tool to assist in
identification of the patient requiring transport to a designated trauma center. The algorithm
does not exclude a patient from identification and transportation to a designated trauma
center if in the judgment of the Base Hospital it is in the patient's best interest.
2. Patients meeting criteria #1: abnormal vital signs/altered level of consciousness, and/or #2:
anatomic injury, and/or #3: mechanism of injury, shall be transported to a designated trauma
center as a major trauma activation.
3. Patients meeting criteria #4: special patient or system considerations, may require transport
to a designated trauma center. Contact the base hospital for determination of destination to
a non-designated trauma center hospital or the appropriate trauma center.
D. All prehospital personnel will be trained in trauma triage as part of standard agency/facility
orientation curriculum, and upon any changes in trauma triage criteria.
