• Keep patient warm
Assess for hypotension
• <1 month: SBP <60 mmHg
• 1 month – 1 year: SBP <70 mmHg

Hypovolemic shock
• IV/IO fluid bolus per drug chart, MR if no rales Ⓐ
Distributive†/cardiogenic shock
• IV/IO fluid bolus per drug chart, MR if no rales Ⓐ
Hypotensive for age after second fluid bolus
• Push-dose epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg/mL)
IV/IO per drug chart, MR q3 min, titrate to adequate
perfusion
Push-dose epinephrine mixing instructions
