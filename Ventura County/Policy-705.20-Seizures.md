## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

• Route for anticonvulsant treatment –
  - The initial priority is cessation of seizure activity. When IV/IO access is not available IM is the preferred route to avoid delays in care.
  - When IV or IO access is available this is the preferred route.
  - Repeat doses should be administered IV/IO whenever possible.

• Patients with a known seizure disorder or uncomplicated, apparent pediatric febrile seizures, no longer seizing and with a normal postictal state, may not require ALS intervention.
