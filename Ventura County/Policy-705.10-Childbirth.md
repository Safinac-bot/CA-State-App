## BLS PROCEDURES

### Determine

- Number of pregnancies (gravida)
- Number of deliveries (para)
- Due date (weeks of gestation)
- Onset/duration/frequency/intensity of contractions
- If a rupture of membranes has occurred (including color/date/time)
- If any expected complications during pregnancy are present
- Presence of crowning or any abnormal presenting part at perineum

---

## PROLAPSED CORD

**DELIVERING**

Assist delivery while initiating Code-3 transport

**NOT DELIVERING**

- Cover cord with wet saline dressing
- Place mother in left-lateral Trendelenberg position
- Provide constant manual pressure on presenting part to avoid cord compression
- Elevate hips
- Initiate Code-3 transport

---

## OTHER PRESENTING PART

**DELIVERING**

Assist with breech delivery while supporting the infant's body (covering to maintain body warmth)

**NOT DELIVERING**

- Place mother in left-lateral Trendelenberg position
- Initiate Code-3 transport

---

## NORMAL DELIVERY PROCEDURES

Initiate Code-3 transport if there is partial delivery of the infant and no further progress after 1-2 minutes

### If the HEAD is crowning, prepare to assist mother with delivery –

**Guide baby out**

**ONLY IF SECRETIONS, INCLUDING MECONIUM, CAUSE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION:** suction mouth, then nose

**Dry and stimulate** (rub gently, but briskly with warm towel, provide stocking cap if available)

While drying infant, assess for prematurity, poor respiratory effort, or lack of muscle tone. If any exist, double clamp and cut cord, and begin resuscitation according to VC EMS Policy 705.16, "Neonatal Resuscitation"

Place infant skin-to-skin with mother, cover both with dry linen, and observe for breathing, activity, and color

Double clamp cord and cut with sterile scissors between clamps

Note time of birth

Begin transport. To help prevent heat loss from infant, turn up the heat in the treatment area of the ambulance
- Do not wait for placenta to deliver

If placenta delivers, assist and package, then gently massage fundus
- Do not massage fundus until the placenta has delivered

---

## NEWBORN ASSESSMENT

At 1 minute and 5 minutes post-delivery (Note: if infant requires resuscitation at birth, defer APGAR scoring to a later time. Resuscitation should not be delayed to assess for APGAR score.)

### APGAR SCORE

| APGAR | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|-------|---|---|---|
| **A - Appearance** | Blue/Pale | Pink w/ blue extremities | Pink |
| **P – Pulse** | Absent | < 100 bpm | > 100 bpm |
| **G – Grimace (reflex irritability)** | Absent | Grimace | Cough/Cry/Sneeze |
