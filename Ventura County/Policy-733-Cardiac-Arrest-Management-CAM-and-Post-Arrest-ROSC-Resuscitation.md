### POST ARREST RESUSCITATION CHECKLIST

#### Initial Actions
- [ ] Initiate 10 minute continuous femoral pulse check
- [ ] Continue rescue breathing as needed
- [ ] Paddles attached and EKG waveform visible
- [ ] VF alarm set, SpO2 and EtCO2 waveforms visible

#### Circulation
- [ ] Obtain peripheral IV access (18 g preferred, 20 g minimum)
- [ ] Initiate NS fluid bolus
- [ ] Assess for peripheral pulses
- [ ] Obtain manual blood pressure
- [ ] Push dose epinephrine IN ADDITION TO fluids for systolic BP < 90 mmHg

#### Airway / Ventilation
- [ ] Assess for responsiveness and spontaneous ventilations
- [ ] Assess EtCO2, lung sounds, SpO2
- [ ] Maintain BLS airway or place advanced airway as indicated
- [ ] Place advanced airway if needed to ventilate while moving patient
- [ ] Oxygenate to SpO2 94% to 99%
- [ ] Oxygen flow rate titrated to prevent SpO2 100%

#### 12 Lead EKG
- [ ] Obtain 12-lead EKG only after managing C-A-B and prior to movement

#### Prior to Moving Patient, Confirm
- [ ] Patient has sustained ROSC approximately ≥ 10 minutes
- [ ] C-A-B have been effectively stabilized or appropriate efforts made
- [ ] Team has planned how to effectively ventilate during move
- [ ] Team is prepared to recognize re-arrest:
  - STOP MOVING
  - RESUME CAM ON SCENE

---

### Post Arrest Resuscitation Transport

- Transport is indicated after a patient has sustained ROSC for approximately 10 minutes and effective efforts have been made to stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation
- Continuous patient assessment and treatment must remain the priority during transport.
- Recognizing hypotension, inadequate ventilation, or re-arrest, will have a large impact on patient outcome.

---

### Re-Arrest Guidelines (Loss of ROSC)

- Re-arrests require the same high-quality CAM and ALS care as the initial arrest:
  - Remain on scene
  - Ensure adequate workspace
  - Begin CAM Procedure
  - Defibrillate VF / VT ASAP
- Provide an additional 20 minutes of high-quality CAM prior to any further movement or initiating transport.
- If ROSC is obtained again, reassess, stabilize C – A – B as indicated, then continue with previous transport plan.
- If no ROSC, or multiple re-arrests, through 20 minutes from initial re-arrest consider underlying cause, circumstances, and presentation, then contact base for consultation.

---

### Prioritizing Care in Re-Arrest

**Re-Arrest On Scene**
- If re-arrest occurs during movement to gurney or ambulance, resume CAM on scene outside of ambulance
- If re-arrest occurs after loading but prior to leaving scene, unload patient from ambulance, resume CAM, and move to workable space

**Re-Arrest During Transport**
- Prioritize immediate and continuous chest compressions
- Prioritize immediate and q 2 min defib for VF/VT
- Reassess patient considering correctable causes and previous interventions
- Confirm advanced airway effective and in place if air-Q or ETT was used

**NOTE:**  
Most re-arrests occur in the first 10 minutes after ROSC is achieved.  
Most delayed identification of re-arrest occurs during movement of the patient and during transport.

---

### NO ROSC - NO ROSC AFTER RE-ARREST - FREQUENT RE-ARREST

### Base Consultation

- Base consultation is indicated when considering DOD vs continuing resuscitation.
- Assessment findings, observations, and clinical circumstances should be clearly communicated during base hospital consultation.
- Direct consultation with base hospital physician is recommended in cases where the clinical scenario may warrant prolonged resuscitation or "early" termination of resuscitation.
