## I. PURPOSE

To establish guidelines for the transfer of a trauma patient from a hospital in Ventura County to a Level II trauma center.

---

## II. AUTHORITY

Health and Safety Code, §1797.160, §1797.161, and §1798, and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, §100136.03.

---

## III. DEFINITIONS

### A. Trauma Call Continuation

A process by which a patient with potential life-or-limb threatening traumatic injuries who has been taken to the emergency department by ALS ambulance is transferred to a trauma center. The patient requires an immediate procedure at a trauma center, the ALS ambulance is still on the premises, and the treating physician requests immediate transport to a designated trauma center.

### B. EMERGENT Transfer

A process by which a patient with potential life-or-limb threatening traumatic injuries is transferred to a trauma center. The patient requires an immediate procedure at a trauma center, and a delay in transfer will result in deterioration of the patient's condition, and the treating physician requests immediate transport to a trauma center.

(Ambulance will arrive within 10 minutes)

### C. URGENT Transfer

A process by which a patient with time-critical traumatic injuries is transferred to a trauma center. The patient requires a timely procedure at a trauma center, and a lengthy delay will result in deterioration of the patient's condition, and the treating physician requests prompt transport to a trauma center.

(Ambulance will arrive within 30 minutes)

### D. NON-URGENT IFT TRAUMA Transfer

A process by which a patient with non-life-threatening injuries and not a time-sensitive injury requires a transfer to a trauma center for further evaluation and care.

---
