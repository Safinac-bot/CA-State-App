   - 4) Patient < 14 Y.O.
   - 5) Traumatic arrest not witnessed by EMS

### 3. Tranexamic Acid (TXA) Administration

a. As indicated in VCEMS Policy 734

---

## 3. HEAD INJURIES

### a. General treatments

1) Evaluate head and face – maintain high index of suspicion for injury if significant mechanism of injury is present or physical examination is remarkable for findings

2) Elevate head 30° unless contraindicated

3) Do not attempt to intubate head injured patients unless unable to manage with BLS airway measures

4) Do not delay transport if significant airway compromise

### b. Penetrating injuries

1) DO NOT REMOVE IMPALED OBJECT (unless airway obstruction is present)

2) Stabilize object manually or with bulky dressings

### c. Facial injuries

1) Assess airway and suction as needed

2) Remove loose teeth or dentures if present

### d. Eye injuries

1) Remove contact lenses

2) Irrigate eye thoroughly with suspected acid/alkali burns

3) Avoid direct pressure

4) Place eye shield over injured eye only

5) Ask patient to keep eyes closed

6) Stabilize any impaled object manually or with bulky dressing

---

## 4. SPINAL CORD INJURIES

### a. General treatments

1) Evaluate spinal column – maintain high index of suspicion for injury if significant mechanism of injury is present or physical examination is remarkable for findings

2) Place patient in supine position if hypotension is present

### b. Penetrating injuries – DO NOT REMOVE IMPALED OBJECT

1) Stabilize object manually or with bulky dressings

2) Control bleeding if present

3) In the presence of isolated penetrating injuries, spinal motion restriction is contraindicated

### c. Neck injuries

1) Monitor airway

2) Control bleeding if present

---

## 5. THORACIC TRAUMA

### a. General treatments

1) Evaluate chest – maintain high index of suspicion for internal injury if significant mechanism of injury is present or physical examination is remarkable for findings

2) Keep patients sitting high-fowlers
   - i. In the presence of isolated penetrating injuries, spinal motion restriction is CONTRAINDICATED

### b. Penetrating injuries – DO NOT REMOVE IMPALED OBJECT

2) Stabilize object manually or with bulky dressings

3) Control bleeding if present

### c. Flail Chest/Rib injuries

1) Assist ventilations if respiratory status deteriorates

### d. Pneumothorax/Hemothorax

1) Keep patient sitting high-fowlers

2) Assist ventilations if respiratory status deteriorates

3) Suspected tension pneumothorax should be managed per VCEMS Policy 715

### e. Open (Sucking) Chest Wound

1) **Beck's Triad**
   - i. Muffled heart tones
   - ii. JVD
   - iii. Hypotension

### g. Traumatic Aortic Disruption

2) Cover wound with saline-soaked dressings

3) Control bleeding if present

### e. Pregnancy

1) Place patient in left-lateral position to prevent supine hypotensive syndrome

### f. Pelvic injuries

1) Assessment of pelvis should be only performed ONCE to limit additional injury

2) Control external bleeding if present

3) Place a commercial binder or sheet if pelvic injury is suspected and patient is hemodynamically unstable (see step one for parameters)

4) Empirically place a binder or sheet if patient is in cardiac arrest due to a blunt or blast injury

5) Consider applying a binder or sheet in patients with suspected pelvic injury without hemodynamic instability

---

## 7. EXTREMITY TRAUMA

### a. General Treatments

1) Evaluate CSM distal to injury
   - i. If decrease or absence in CSM is present:
