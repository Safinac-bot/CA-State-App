## V. PROCEDURE

### A. Suspected abuse of an elder or a dependent adult

1. Report online at ReporttoAPS.org or call 805-654-3200 within 48 hours of receiving information concerning the incident.

   a. Reporting online satisfies the State requirement for mandated reporters to call in and mail/fax a report.

   b. If online reporting cannot be done, reports may be emailed to HSA-APS-Referrals@ventura.org or faxed to 805-650-1521.

2. Failure to report suspected abuse of an elder or a dependent adult

   a. Failure to report, or impeding or inhibiting a report of, physical abuse, as defined in Section 15610.63, abandonment, abduction, isolation, financial abuse, or neglect of an elder or dependent adult, in violation of this section, is a misdemeanor, punishable by not more than six months in the county jail, by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment. A mandated reporter who willfully fails to report, or impedes or inhibits a report of, physical abuse, as defined in Section 15610.63, abandonment, abduction, isolation, financial abuse, or neglect of an elder or dependent adult, in violation of this section, if that abuse results in death or great bodily injury, shall be punished by not more than one year in a county jail, by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment. If a mandated reporter intentionally conceals their failure to report an incident known by the mandated reporter to be abuse or severe neglect under this section, the failure to report is a continuing offense until a law enforcement agency specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 15630 discovers the offense.

### B. Suspected child abuse or neglect

1. Make an initial report by telephone immediately or as soon as practically possible to the 24-hour hotline 805-654-3200.

2. Submit a written report within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident: (Form BCIA 8572) to HSA-CFS-SCAR@ventura.org.

3. Failure to report suspected child abuse or neglect

   a. A mandated reporter who fails to report an incident of known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect as required by this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months confinement in a county jail or by a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by both that imprisonment and fine. If a mandated reporter intentionally conceals the mandated reporter's failure to report an incident known by the mandated reporter to be abuse or severe neglect under this section, the failure to report is a continuing offense until an agency specified in Section 11165.9 discovers the offense.

### C. Team Reporting
When two (2) or more persons, who are required to report, are present and jointly have knowledge of a suspected instance of child abuse or neglect, or abuse of an elder or a dependent adult, and when there is agreement among them, the telephone report may be made by a member of the team selected by mutual agreement and a single report may be made and signed by such selected member of the reporting team. Any member who has knowledge that the member designated to report has failed to do so, shall thereafter make such report.

### D. Individual Responsibility
The reporting duties are individual, and no supervisor or administrator may impede or inhibit such reporting duties and no person making such report shall be subject to any sanction for making such report. However, internal procedures to facilitate reporting and apprise supervisors and administrators of reports may be established provided that they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this article.
