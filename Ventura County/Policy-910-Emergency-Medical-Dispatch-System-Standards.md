## I. PURPOSE

To establish standardized procedures for caller interrogation prioritized dispatch and pre-arrival instructions to be used by approved Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) programs within Ventura County.

---

## II. AUTHORITY

Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.204.

---

## III. POLICY

### A. Each Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) will develop a plan to provide Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) to callers requiring medical assistance. This plan will be submitted to Ventura County Emergency Medical Services (VC EMS) for approval within 6 months of the implementation date of this policy. The EMD Plan will address, at a minimum, all of the following:

1. Providing emergency medical service response on a continuous twenty-four (24) hour per day basis;

2. Ensuring the EMD call answering point maintains direct access to the calling party;

3. Mechanism to make available VCEMS EMD Cards to all dispatchers for use on all medical calls;

4. Identification of a person to be responsible for the emergency response and information resources;

5. An established quantitative coding system for quality assurance and statistical analysis;

6. A written description of the communications system configuration for the service area including telephone and radio service resources; and

7. A record-keeping system, including report forms or a computer data management system to permit evaluation of patient care records to ensure EMD compliance with the EMD protocols, evaluation of protocol effectiveness, and timeliness of interview questions and dispatch.

### B. PSAPs will either provide EMD or transfer EMS calls immediately to a PSAP that provides EMD. A statement outlining the agreement between PSAPs will be sent to VC EMS. A PSAP that transfers EMS calls to another PSAP for EMD services shall be responsible for securing an agreement for the provision of those services.

### C. Requests for medical assistance will be medically prioritized, based upon the procedures in this policy; appropriate resources will be assigned to the incident; and pre-arrival telephone medical instructions will be provided, unless precluded by emergency situations. Inability to schedule trained and accredited personnel does not constitute an emergency situation. Documentation of times when EMD is not provided will be submitted to VCEMS with the other data required.

### D. The medical dispatch protocols are specifically developed for use by medical dispatchers who have been trained and certified by the EMS Medical Director. The use of these protocols by other personnel is not authorized.

### E. The Ventura County Emergency Medical Dispatch / Priority Dispatch (PD) Protocols shall be the only approved protocols utilized by EMD agencies within Ventura County.

### F. The local EMS agency may deny, suspend, or revoke the approval of an EMD agency for failure to comply with medical control, medical accountability, and quality improvement of the EMD program.

---

## III. DEFINITIONS

### A. Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD)

EMD is a program consisting of caller interrogation, prioritized dispatch, and pre-arrival instructions.

### B. EMD Caller Interrogation

EMD Caller Interrogation is a process by which the dispatcher questions calling party to determine appropriate dispatch priority and pre-arrival instructions.

### C. Priority Dispatch

Priority Dispatch is a process by which the EMS Dispatcher determines, through structured caller interrogation, the most appropriate response priority for EMS units.

### D. EMD Priority I Response

EMD Priority I Response is an EMS response to a patient whose medical condition, as determined by EMD protocol, requires an emergency response.

### E. EMD Priority II Response

EMD Priority II Response is an EMS response to a patient whose medical condition, as determined by EMD protocol, requires a prompt but not emergency, response.

### F. EMD Pre-arrival Instructions

EMD Pre-arrival Instructions are medical care instructions given to the caller after dispatch of EMS Units.

### G. EMD Priority Notification Interval

EMD Priority Notification Interval is the interval of time between the first ring at an EMD PSAP to the start of notification to the responding unit.

---

## IV. PROCEDURES

### A. EMD Call Entry

Upon the receipt of a request for medical assistance, the EMS Dispatcher shall obtain the following minimum call information: nature of the problem, location / address, and callback number.

### B. EMD Call Assessment

Utilizing the VCEMS approved EMD / PD Cards, the EMS Dispatcher will assess the severity of the patient's condition, prioritize the medical response, determine the necessary resources, and determine the need for and, as appropriate, provide pre-arrival telephone medical instructions.

### C. EMD Questions

EMD questions are designed to identify the priority and/or the need for pre-arrival instructions. The EMD Dispatcher shall limit medical questioning to these dispatch questions. Once a dispatch priority is determined and the dispatch is made the dispatcher shall move to treatment questions.

1. If a call is dispatched CE1, CE2, or CE3, the dispatcher should complete call entry questioning, if possible. If no priority determinant is identified in call entry, the dispatcher will proceed to Dispatch Questions.

2. If all dispatch questions are asked and no priority determinant is identified, the EMD Dispatcher will notify the responding agencies that a call initially dispatched as Priority I is now determined to be a Priority II response.

### D. EMD Dispatch Upgrades

The EMD Dispatcher will notify the responding agencies of information indicating that a call initially dispatched as Priority II is now determined to be a Priority I response. This would include new information received from a reporting party or on scene EMS personnel.

### E. EMD Dispatch Downgrades

The EMD Dispatcher will notify all responding agencies of information indicating that a call initially dispatched as Priority I is now determined to be a Priority II response. This would include new information received from a reporting party or on scene EMS personnel. The responding agency(ies) may determine whether to downgrade the response.

### F. Dispatch Intervals

#### 1. Definition of Intervals

##### a. For 9-1-1 calls:

(1) **Primary PSAP:** Starts at the 1st ring and ends at the beginning of the transfer of the call to the secondary PSAP.

(2) **Secondary and Combined PSAPs:** Starts at the 1st ring and ends when BOTH the dispatch of the fire department and the notification of ambulance company have begun.

##### b. For 7 Digit Calls

(1) **Primary PSAP:** Starts at the CAD entry and ends at the beginning of transfer of the call to the secondary PSAP.

(2) **Secondary and Combined PSAPs:** Starts at the CAD entry and ends when BOTH dispatch of the fire department and the notification of ambulance company have begun.

(3) **Ambulance Company:** Starts at the CAD entry and ends when BOTH beginning of dispatch of ambulance AND beginning of notification of fire department have begun.

#### 2. PSAPs and Ambulance Company Dispatch Centers will process 90% of emergency calls, according to the definitions above, within the time interval (measured in seconds) specified below:

| Call Type | Primary PSAP (VCSO, SVPD) | Secondary PSAP (VCFPD) | Combined PSAP (OPD/FD) | Ambulance Company |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Those calls that are identified as Priority I from the Call Entry Card. | 30 | 120 | 150 | 150 |
| Those calls identified as Priority I after the Call Entry Card. | 30 | 150 | 180 | 180 |
| Priority II Calls | 30 | 180 | 210 | 210 |

#### 3. All late dispatches will be reviewed by the EMD Program CQI Coordinator to determine if the delays in dispatch were reasonably preventable. The CQI Coordinator will submit a monthly summary to VCEMS.

### G. Notification of EMD to Responding Units

1. The ambulance response agency will acknowledge the dispatch either by a telephone call from the ambulance company dispatch center to the EMD PSAP or by the responding unit on the radio frequency assigned by the EMD PSAP within 1.5 minutes of the dispatch. If the ambulance dispatch center does not acknowledge the dispatch notification within 1.5 minutes, the EMT PSAP will confirm the en route status of the ambulance unit on the EMD PSAP assigned frequency. If there is still no acknowledgement, the EMD PSAP will telephone the ambulance dispatch center.

2. Information updates will be relayed to the ambulance dispatch center.

3. If a unit that is responding to a Priority II call is redirected to a Priority I call, the redirecting agency will notify the other responding agencies.
