---

## III. POLICY

Paramedics may administer push dose epinephrine to adult and pediatric patients as defined by VCEMSA treatment protocols.

---

## IV. PROCEDURE

### A. Classification

1. Sympathomimetic agent (catecholamine)

### B. Indications

1. Anaphylaxis with shock (ref: 705.02 – Allergic reaction / anaphylaxis)
2. Hypotension secondary to presumed cardiogenic shock (ref: 705.09 – Chest Pain – Acute Coronary Syndrome, 705.21 – SOB – Pulmonary Edema)
3. Hypotension secondary to Crush Injury (ref: 705.11 – Crush Injury)
4. Symptomatic bradycardia (ref: 705.24 – Symptomatic Bradycardia)
5. Sepsis Alert (ref: 705.27 – Suspect Shock)
6. Deteriorating patient condition with unknown shock etiology

### C. Contraindications

1. None

### D. Adverse Effects

**Cardiovascular**
- Tachycardia
- Hypertension
- Chest Pain
- Palpitations
- Arrhythmias

**Neurological**
- Anxiety
- Dizziness
- Headache
- Tremors

**Gastrointestinal**
- Nausea / Vomiting

### E. Actions

Increases blood pressure and cardiac output via stimulation of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.

### F. Preparing the Concentration

#### 1. Adults and Pediatrics

**Using a "cardiac preload": 1 mg/10mL (0.1 mg/mL or 100 mcg/mL)**

**Supplies Needed:**
- 1 – 0.1 mg/mL epinephrine preload syringe
- 1 – 100 mL bag of 0.9% normal saline
- 1 – 1 mL syringe

**Mixing Instructions:**
- Push 10 mL of 0.1 mg/mL epinephrine from preload into 100mL bag of normal saline
- Final concentration is essentially 10 mcg/mL (0.01 mg)

#### 2. Points to Remember

- Confirm your concentration prior to mixing
- Maintain sterile technique
- Label the bag with the drug name and final concentration
  - Example: "Epinephrine 10 mcg/mL"
- DO NOT administer epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate in the same vascular access line and/or location unless that line has been flushed with at least 10mL of normal saline.

### G. Dosing

#### 1. Adults

- 1mL (10mcg) every 2 minutes, slow IV/IO push
  - Titrate to SBP of greater than or equal to 90 mm/Hg

#### 2. Pediatrics

- 0.1 mL/kg (1 mcg/kg) every 2 minutes, slow IV/IO push
  - Max single dose of 1 mL or 10 mcg
  - Titrate to SBP of greater than or equal to 80 mm/Hg

### H. Communication and Documentation

1. Communicate the use of push dose epinephrine to base hospital
   - Include final concentration delivered
   - Report total amount of push dose epinephrine administered, total elapsed time of administration, and patient response

2. Administration of epinephrine and any/all associated fields will be documented in the Ventura County electronic Patient Care Report (VCePCR)

### I. Alternative Concentrations

1. In the event of a shortage that limits a provider agency from obtaining the necessary 100 mL bags of normal saline solution, please see below for acceptable alternatives:

   - **Discard 1 mL from 10 mL saline flush syringe and draw 1 mL from epinephrine preload into flush syringe.** This creates a solution of 10 mcg per 1 mL.
   
   - **Draw 5 mL of from epinephrine preload into 50 mL bag of normal saline.** This essentially creates a solution of 10 mcg per 1 mL.
