## III. POLICY

### A. When requested by law enforcement and absent any contraindications as outlined in policy, probes may be removed by EMS personnel.

### B. If EMS transport is indicated or requested by law enforcement EMS personnel should transport to the closest receiving facility, appropriate specialty care facility, or the hospital requested by law enforcement.

---

## IV. PROCEDURE

### A. Be sure the scene has been deemed safe and secured by law enforcement before evaluating and treating the patient.

### B. Before touching any patient where the conducted electrical weapon has been deployed, ensure law enforcement has disconnected cartridge from the handheld unit.

### C. Any injuries or medical conditions will be treated according to the appropriate treatment protocol.

### D. If the transporting paramedic determines that the patient is a risk to him/herself and/or the ambulance personnel, law enforcement officer(s) may be requested to accompany the patient.

### E. Conducted Electrical Weapon Probe Removal:

If one or both of the probes require removal for safe transportation or if removal requested by law enforcement:

1. Procedure must be witnessed by the arresting law enforcement officer. Identify the appropriate officer and confirm they are ready to witness the procedure.

2. Verify the cartridge has been removed from the handle or has been cut.

3. Used probes shall be considered a sharp biohazard, similar to used hypodermic needle. Standard safety precautions should be taken.

4. Place one hand on the patient in the area where the probe is embedded and stabilize the skin surrounding the puncture site between two fingers. With your other hand, in one fluid motion pull the probe straight out from the puncture site.

5. Reinsert probes, point down, into the discharged air cartridge and hand it to the law enforcement officer.

6. Use appropriate antiseptic wipe to cleanse the skin surrounding the puncture site.

7. Apply direct pressure for bleeding and apply a sterile dressing to the wound site.

8. Assess for any injuries that may need medical attention and seek appropriate level of care.

### F. Contraindications:

1. If the conducted electrical weapon has penetrated a sensitive area (e.g. head, face, neck, hand bone, axilla, groin, female breast), Do NOT remove the probe as injury may occur to bone, nerves, blood vessels, or an eye. Transport the patient to the ED in an appropriate position.

### G. Documentation:

1. Any EMS incidents resulting from conducted electrical weapon deployment or probe removal will be documented in the Ventura County Electronic Patient Care Reporting System. Refer to policy 1000: Documentation of Prehospital Care.

2. Incidents that do not result in EMS transport will be documented as outlined in VCEMS policy 603: Refusal of EMS Services.

3. If probes are removed by EMS personnel documentation will include that procedure as well as the requesting law enforcement officer and/or agency.
