## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

• Certain oral hypoglycemic agents (e.g. - sulfonylureas) and long-acting insulin preparations have a long duration of action, sometimes up to 72 hours. Patients on these medications who would like to decline transport MUST be warned about the risk of repeat hypoglycemia for up to 3 days, which can occur during sleep and result in the patient's death. If the patient continues to decline further care, every effort must be made to have the patient speak to the ED Physician prior to leaving the scene.

• If patient has an ALOC and Blood Glucose level is greater than 60 mg/dl, consider alternate causes:

**A E I O U T I P S**

- **A** - Alcohol
- **E** - Epilepsy
- **I** - Insulin
- **O** - Overdose
- **U** - Uremia
- **T** - Trauma
- **I** - Infection
- **P** - Psychiatric
- **S** - Stroke
