## I. PURPOSE

To define the indications, procedure and documentation for the use of transcutaneous cardiac pacing by paramedics

---

## II. AUTHORITY

Health and Safety Code, Sections 1797.220 and 1798. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 100145 and 100169.

---

## III. POLICY

Paramedics may utilize transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP) on adult patients (age 14 or greater) in accordance with Ventura County Policy 705 – Symptomatic Bradycardia, Adult.

---

## IV. PROCEDURE

### A. Training

Prior to using TCP the paramedic must successfully complete a training program approved by the VC EMS Medical Director, which includes operation of the device to be used.

### B. Indications

Symptomatic bradycardia (heart rate less than 40 bpm with one or more of the following signs or symptoms):

1. Altered level of consciousness
2. Chest pain
3. Abnormal skin signs
4. Profound weakness
5. Shortness of breath
6. Hypotensive (Systolic BP less than 90mm Hg)

### C. Contraindications

#### 1. Absolute

a. Asystole

#### 2. Relative:

a. Hypothermia – patient warming measures have precedence. (Base Hospital contact required).

### D. Patient Treatment

1. Patient assessment and treatment per 705: Bradycardia treatment protocol. If IV/IO access not promptly available, proceed to pacing.

2. Explain procedure to the patient.

3. Place pacing electrodes and attach pacing cable to pacing device per manufacturer's recommendations.

4. Set pacing mode to demand mode, pacing rate to 70 BPM, and current at 40 milliamps (mA), or manufacturer recommendation.

5. If required, provide patient pain relief. Patients with profound shock and markedly altered level of consciousness may not require pain relief.

6. Activate pacing device and increase the current in 10 mA increments until capture is achieved (i.e., pacemaker produces pulse with each paced QRS complex).

7. Assess patient for mechanical capture and clinical improvement (BP, pulses, skin signs, LOC).

**NOTE:** Patients with high grade AV block (second degree type II or third-degree block) who do not have symptoms do not require pacing. However, equipment should be immediately available if symptoms arise. Patients with symptoms who respond initially to atropine should have pacing equipment immediately available.

### E. Documentation

1. The use of TCP must be documented.

2. Vital signs must be documented every 5 minutes.
