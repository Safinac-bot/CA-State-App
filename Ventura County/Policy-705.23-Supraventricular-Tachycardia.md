## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

• *Special circumstances for sedation prior to cardioversion include fully awake and alert, patients with unstable vital signs.

• Adenosine temporarily blocks AV nodal conduction with the goal of terminating AVNRT.

• Administration should be reserved for cases with a high suspicion of electrical dysfunction and where heart rate is suspected to be the cause of symptoms. Generally, treatment should be reserved for heart rates greater than 150.

• Consider patient potential underlying causes of tachycardia (sepsis, hypovolemia, heart failure) to aid in identifying cases where transport without Adenosine administration may be appropriate.

• Synchronized cardioversion is indicated for unstable patients with any tachycardic dysrhythmia including rapidly conducting atrial fibrillation and rapidly conducting atrial flutter.

• Document all ECG strips during adenosine administration and/or synchronized cardioversion.
