## III. POLICY

---

## IV. PROCEDURE

### A. Recognition

1. BRUE is used to describe an event occurring in an infant less than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of 1 or more of the following:
   a. Cyanosis or pallor
   b. Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing
   c. Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)
   d. Altered level of responsiveness

2. These events are characterized as "brief" (less than 1 minute and usually less than 20 – 30 seconds) and "resolved" (meaning the patient returned to baseline state of health after the event).

3. BRUEs are also "unexplained," meaning that a clinician is unable to explain the cause of the event after an appropriate history and physical examination.

4. **High and Low-risk Infants**

   **a. High-risk infants**
   - Infants less than 2 months of age
   - History of prematurity (higher in infants born at less than 32 weeks)
   - More than one event

   **b. Low-risk infants**
   - Age greater than 60 days
   - Born greater than or equal to 32 weeks gestation
   - Corrected gestational age is greater than or equal to 45 weeks
   - First event (no previous BRUE ever and not occurring in clusters)
   - Event lasted less than 1 minute
   - No CPR by trained medical provider
   - No concerning historical features
   - No concerning physical examination findings

   **c. Infants who have experienced a BRUE who do not qualify as lower-risk patients are, by definition, at higher risk.**

### B. Assessment and Treatment

1. Perform a physical exam that includes general appearance, skin color, extent of interaction with the environment, and evidence of current or past trauma.
   **Note: Exam May Be Normal.**

2. Obtain medical history, family history, and history of the event.

3. Treat any identifiable causes as indicated.

4. Base Hospital contact required.

### C. Precautions

1. In most cases, the infant will have a normal physical exam when assessed by healthcare providers. The parent/caregiver's perception that "something is or was wrong" must be taken seriously. Assume the history given is accurate.

2. Keep in mind, especially if the parent/guardian declines transport to the hospital, that child abuse may be a cause of the BRUE symptoms listed above.
   a. If child abuse is suspected, refer to the reporting guidelines in VCEMS Policy 210.
