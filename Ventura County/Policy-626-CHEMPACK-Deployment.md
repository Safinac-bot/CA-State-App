## I. PURPOSE

This policy establishes guidelines for the deployment and use of the CHEMPACK by pre-hospital care providers in response to incidents involving suspected nerve agent exposure.

---

## II. AUTHORITY

Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Sections 1797.220 & 1798.

---

## III. DEFINITION

The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has established the "CHEMPACK" project for the forward placement of sustainable repositories of nerve agent antidotes in numerous locations throughout the United States, so that they can be immediately accessible for the treatment of exposed and affected persons.

There are two types of CHEMPACKs available. The "Hospital CHEMPACK" is designed for hospital and healthcare provider use, consisting mostly of single dose vials and a small quantity of auto-injectors. The "EMS CHEMPACK" is designed for field use and contains mostly auto-injectors. Ventura County has elected to only host EMS CHEMPACKs.

### Content of CHEMPACKs

| Unit Pack | Units | Cases | Quantity |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Pralidoxime 600 mg Auto-Injector | 240 | 5 | 1200 |
| Atropine Sulfate 0.4 mg/ml 20 ml | 100 | 1 | 100 |
| Pralidoxime 1 gm inj. 20 ml | 276 | 1 | 276 |
| Atropen 0.5 mg | 144 | 1 | 144 |

| Diazepam 5 mg/ml auto-injector | 150 | 2 | 300 |
| Midazolam 5mg/mL vial, 10mL | 50 | 1 | 50 |
| Sterile water for inj (SWFI) 20ml vials | 100 | 2 | 200 |

## IV. POLICY

Actual location of the CHEMPACK will be maintained as confidential. This policy outlines the responsibilities and the operational requirements to pre-position or utilize a cache within the Ventura County Operational Area.

In the case of an accidental or deliberate release of a nerve agent or potent organophosphate compound, time will be of the essence to minimize morbidity and mortality. This is a key consideration in cache placement, notification, transportation and administration.

## V. PROCEDURE: CHEMPACK Deployment and Movement

### A. Authorization to Open or Forward Deploy a CHEMPACK Container – Emergency Incident Based:

1. The Ventura County EMS Agency shall be contacted for authorization to open or forward deploy any CHEMPACK within the Ventura County Operational Area. The EMS Agency Duty Officer can be accessed on a 24-hour basis by calling the Ventura County Fire Department Fire Communications Center at 805-388-4279.

2. In the event that return contact by the EMS Agency Duty Officer is delayed and the situation clearly warrants immediate action, the CHEMPACK provider may elect to open or forward deploy the CHEMPACK for an emergency incident. Attempts to contact the EMS Agency Duty Officer shall be made in all cases through the Fire Communications Center.

3. The EMS Agency may request deployment of a CHEMPACK to a location within the Ventura County Operational Area or outside the operational area under a medical-health mutual aid request. The CHEMPACK provider shall make CHEMPACK resources immediately available upon request by the EMS Agency.

4. The EMS Agency shall immediately notify the Region 1 Regional Disaster Medical Health Specialist (RDMHS) of any CHEMPACK movement from fixed locations or opening of a CHEMPACK container. The RDMHS will ensure that California Department of Health Services / Emergency Preparedness Office (DHS/EPO) is notified promptly of any movement or deployment of CHEMPACK material. DHS/EPO will in turn notify ASPR.

5. **Qualifying Events – Emergency Deployment:** CHEMPACK material may be accessed, deployed or used only when it is determined that an accidental or intentional nerve agent or other organophosphate release has threatened the public health security of a community. A seal will be broken and material used only when it is determined that other means to save human life will not be sufficient. Authorization to deploy, break the seal on, or move a CHEMPACK container from its specified location will be limited to any of the following events:

   a. Release of a nerve agent or potent organophosphate with human effects or immediate threats too great to adequately manage with other pharmaceutical supplies available.

   b. Large or unusual occurrence of patients presenting with signs and/or symptoms consistent with nerve agent or organophosphate exposure or intoxication.

   c. A credible threat of an imminent event of a magnitude likely to require the assets of the CHEMPACK.

   d. An event with potential to create a nerve agent or organophosphate release with human exposure (e.g. a transportation accident with fire or loss of container integrity).

   e. Any mutual aid request from another region or neighboring state in which CHEMPACK assets are being deployed or staged.

   f. Any event which, in the judgment of the County Health Officer, EMS Agency Medical Director, or Medical & Health Operational Area Coordinator (MHOAC), justifies the deployment of CHEMPACK supplies.

   g. A physical threat to the CHEMPACK at the fixed location (i.e. fire, theft, flood).

### B. Authorization to Forward Deploy a CHEMPACK Container – Event or Threat Planning:

1. The EMS Agency may authorize movement of a CHEMPACK container and contents to any location within the Ventura County Operational Area, or outside the area under a medical-health mutual aid request. The EMS Agency will notify the Region 1 RDMHS in advance of any pre-planned CHEMPACK container movement for a particular event or threat.

2. **Qualifying Events – Pre-Emptive Deployment:** Pre-emptive movement is the relocation of a sealed CHEMPACK container and its contents to a site providing for levels of environmental and security controls generally identical to those required for its regular placement site. Breaking the seal, removing any contents, or moving the cache to a location without those controls constitutes deployment, not pre-emptive movement, and must meet deployment conditions.

   a. Pre-emptive movements may be requested to the EMS Agency by any emergency medical, public health, emergency management, hazardous materials or other related agency in preparation for, or response to, a planned or occurring event deemed appropriate for forward CHEMPACK placement.

   b. Any such request must be made to the RDMHS for approval. Unless an imminent or ongoing emergency, each request must be made at least 48 hours before the movement. The RDMHS will refer any request to the RDMHC and to DHS/EPO for consideration. If an RDMHS is unavailable to take timely action on a movement request, that request may be made to DHS/EPO via the State Warning Center.

### C. Post Event Actions:

1. Incident documentation should begin as soon as possible following any emergency operation involving CHEMPACK assets by the EMS Agency. The documentation must include the following:

   a. A thorough description of the incident or event involving CHEMPACK resources.

   b. A list of the approving officials.

   c. An inventory of used and unused CHEMPACK contents.

   d. An after-action critique of CHEMPACK deployment effectiveness.

2. The CHEMPACK container and any unused contents will be returned to the CHEMPACK Provider and will be resealed. The EMS Agency will coordinate resupply with the Region 1 RDMHS, DHS/EPO and the ASPR as appropriate. Currently the CHEMPACK Project is not funded to replace CHEMPACK supplies used for an emergency event. However, requests for replenishment of CHEMPACK supplies should be made to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) Program as soon as possible after their use. The SNS Program will attempt to secure federal funding to replace and restock supplies used in response to an emergency event.
