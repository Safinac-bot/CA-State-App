## I. PURPOSE

This policy outlines the procedures whereby prehospital care providers accept a newborn under the California Safe Haven Law. This law as amended allows a person to surrender a minor child, less than 72 hours old to a person at any designated fire station, or emergency room without fear of arrest or prosecution, provided that the infant has not been abused or neglected. According to the law, "no person or entity that accepts a surrendered child shall be subject to civil, criminal, or administrative liability for accepting the child and caring for the child in the good faith belief that action is required or authorized by the bill, including but not limited to instances where the child is older than 72 hours or the person surrendering the child did not have lawful physical custody of the child".
