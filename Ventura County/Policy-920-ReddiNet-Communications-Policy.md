## I. PURPOSE

The Rapid Emergency Digital Data Network (REDDINET) is the computerized system that links hospitals, the EMS Agency, and Public Health for a variety of purposes; including but not limited to daily (Q24 hr) reports of diversion status, multiple casualty incidents (MCI), assessment communication, disease surveillance, and current HAvBED status. This policy defines the expectation for the use and maintenance of ReddiNet by all facilities.

---

## II. AUTHORITY

Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Chapter 1, Section 1797.204 and Chapter 6, Section 1798.100.

---

## III. POLICY

### A. The ReddiNet System is to be maintained by each individual facility. This includes, but is not limited to, maintenance and upgrade of all associated hardware, software, and licensing.

### B. It is the responsibility of each facility to ensure that any staff expected to use the ReddiNet System be properly trained and refreshed on a routine basis (at least twice per year). At least one staff member who is knowledgeable on the use of the ReddiNet System is to be on duty at all times.

### C. The ReddiNet System is to remain online at all times unless there is a hardware or software problem that disables the system, in which case every effort shall be made to correct the problem as quickly as possible.

### D. The sound volume on the ReddiNet System is to be maintained at an adequate level to alert staff within a facility at all times, and is never to be placed on mute.

### E. The ReddiNet System shall be placed in an easily accessible location within each facility.

### F. The use of the ReddiNet computer is limited to operation of the ReddiNet System and access to EMS educational materials only. Accessing the Internet or other applications on the system is prohibited.

### G. VCEMS may send an Assessment Poll as needed. Each facility is to acknowledge and respond to this poll as directed by the system.

### H. The ReddiNet System is not to be used to disseminate non-system information such as conference flyers, educational opportunities, and other like materials.

---

## IV. PROCEDURE

### A. Emergency Department and other appropriate hospital staff will use ReddiNet for the following information:

#### 1. Status – Hospitals will utilize the ReddiNet System to update all diversion status pursuant to VCEMS Policy 402. Hospitals should note that the ReddiNet System also displays diversion status for other facilities within the region.

#### 2. Multi Casualty Incidents (MCI) – During an MCI, the designated Base Hospital will coordinate response activities with other hospitals using ReddiNet unless relieved by EMS Agency personnel. The Base Hospitals will initiate an MCI using the ReddiNet MCI function. All patients received by hospitals during an MCI are to be recorded in ReddiNet, within the MCI function. The System will send an alert tone when a facility is being included in an MCI response.

#### 3. Assessment – This function within the ReddiNet System allows a facility or the EMS Agency to assess the status of other facilities and other resources (such as staffing, equipment, etc). Assessments are polls that ask specific questions and require a response. All facilities are to respond as quickly as possible to active polls. Assessments contain one or more questions whose answers are formatted (I.e., Yes/No, numeric, multiple choice, text, etc) The System will send an alert tone when Assessments are received.

#### 4. Public Health Surveillance – The Public Health Department may initiate disease surveillance programs utilizing Reddi-Net. These will be in the form of assessment polls that ask for specific information on a routine basis. Each facility is to ensure that these assessments are answered in a timely manner. This will likely require involvement of Infectious/Communicable Disease staff at each facility. This does not replace the obligation of health care providers to report certain diseases on a Confidential Morbidity Report (CMR) pursuant to Title 17, California Code of Regulations, §2500 (rev. 2022) Reports & Diseases

#### 5. Messages – All facilities are expected to utilize the ReddiNet messaging function to communicate appropriate information within their facility, with other hospitals, the EMS Agency and the Public Health Department. The system is similar to email. All messages that are appropriate for dissemination to other staff are to be printed or otherwise shared with affected staff. The System will send an alert tone when messages are received.

#### 6. HAvBED Status – Hospitals are expected to update their current HAvBED status by 9:00 AM on a daily basis. Updates ideally should be done twice per day, morning and evening shift. Hospitals should update their bed availability after their normally scheduled daily discharge time. HAvBED shall be the only function utilized on ReddiNet for the purposes of assessing bed capacity.

7. Daily HAvBED status updates allow facilities to meet Federal bed availability guidelines. The HAvBED status board carries over all fields from the previous bed availability menu as well as adding two additional fields: ventilators (owned, stockpiled or committed by vendor to the facility), and whether or not a mass decontamination system is available at the facility during the specified time frame.

### B. ReddiNet System Failure or Disruption

#### 1. If the ReddiNet System is not functioning due to an internal hospital issue (ie: computer, satellite, or internet failure), facilities are to utilize the following procedure:

a. Attempt to the resolve the problem at the computer. Check for correct power and internet connections as well as correct log-in and password.

b. Check Satellite for any obstruction or damage

c. Notify the facility ReddiNet coordinator or IT department according to facility policy.

d. Notify the EMS Agency of the status of the ReddiNet System and the anticipated return to service.

e. Fax Appendix A to the EMS Agency and all facilities in your hospital grouping to notify of your current diversion status. Updates should be provided every 8 hours until the system is functional. If available, the EMS Agency will update facility status on the ReddiNet System. For Internal Disaster category only, fax should also be sent to Fire Communications Center (FCC).

f. Notify other hospitals, EMS Agency and FCC via ReddiNet when connection is restored.

#### 2. If the ReddiNet System is not functioning due to a systemwide issue, (ie: ReddiNet server or internet service provider failure), facilities are to utilize the following procedure:

a. Notify the EMS Agency of the ReddiNet System failure.

b. FAX Appendix A to the EMS Agency and all facilities in your hospital grouping to notify of your current diversion status. Updates should be provided every 8 hours until the system is functional. For Internal Disaster category only, fax should also be sent to Fire Communications Center (FCC).

c. ReddiNet and/or the EMS Agency will notify all facilities and FCC when service is restored.

### C. Hospital Groupings
