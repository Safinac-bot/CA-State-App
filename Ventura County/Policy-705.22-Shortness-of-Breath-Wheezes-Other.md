## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

• If hypotensive, consider alternative etiologies and refer to additional treatment protocols.

• High flow O2 is indicated for severe respiratory distress, even with a history of COPD

• COPD patients have a higher susceptibility to spontaneous pneumothorax due to disease process

• If suspected Arterial Gas Embolus/Decompression Sickness secondary to SCUBA emergencies, transport patient in supine position on 15L/min O2 via mask. Early BH contact is recommended to determine most appropriate transport destination.
