## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

• Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in inferior infarct or when phosphodiesterase inhibitor medications [Sildenafil (Viagra and Revatio), Vardenafil (Levitra), and Tadalafil (Cialis)] have been recently used (Viagra or Levitra within 24 hours; Cialis within 48 hours). These medications are most commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension. NTG then may only be given by ED Physician order

• Appropriate dose of Aspirin is 324mg. Aspirin may be withheld if able to confirm that patient has received appropriate dose prior to arrival. If unable to confirm appropriate dose, administer Aspirin, up to 324mg.
