## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

• The risk of a crush syndrome increases with the duration of the crush injury. Anticipate clinical decompensation when patient is extricated

• Crush Syndrome – Continuous crush injury to torso or extremity above wrist or ankle.

• Dysrhythmias are usually secondary to Hyperkalemia. ECG monitor may show: Peaked T-waves, Absent P-waves, widened QRS complexes, bradycardia

• Calcium Chloride and Sodium Bicarbonate precipitate when mixed. Strongly consider starting a second IV (if feasible) for administration of Calcium Chloride
