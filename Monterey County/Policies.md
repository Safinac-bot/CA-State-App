EMS CALL ROUTING AND PROCESSING
I. PURPOSE
To define the requirements and procedures for Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) and
Public Safety Agencies to identify and route all appropriate Medical Calls to a designated EMS
Communications Center in Monterey County, so that certified Emergency Medical Dispatchers
can provide Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) services. These procedures include both
concurrence or non-concurrence of Public Safety Agencies with jurisdiction to continue
delegation of EMS call processing or to maintain EMS call processing within a Public Safety
jurisdiction.
II. POLICY
A. Concurrence: All appropriate Medical Calls in Monterey County, once identified, shall be
immediately routed to a designated Monterey County EMS Communications Center for
proper MPDS assessment, Post-Dispatch Instructions, and Pre-Arrival Instructions. This
includes all first, second, and appropriate third-party callers.
B. Non-Concurrence: All appropriate Medical Calls in Monterey County, once identified,
shall immediately receive proper MPDS assessment, Post-Dispatch Instructions, and PreArrival Instructions by Public Safety communications personnel in compliance with EMS
System Policies.
III. PROCEDURE
A. Concurrence Public Safety/PSAP Medical Call Routing:
1. All Medical Call phone transfers shall ensure ANI/ALI information, if available,
is sent with the caller to the designated EMS Communications Center.
2. The designated EMS Communications Center shall work with local PSAPs to
develop and implement policies that address special call handling procedures,
including but not limited to: multiple callers for a single incident, language barrier
calls, and rescue events.
3. All Monterey County PSAPs shall ensure that call intake procedures only obtain
essential information on Medical Calls prior to transfer of the caller to the
designated EMS Communications Center and shall not conduct any medical
screening or other redundant questioning contained within a MPDS interrogation.
a. An exception to the routing of the caller in this policy is when a PSAP
determines it is not safe to transfer the caller to the designated EMS
Communications Center. In those cases, such as Law Enforcement calls,
scene safety concerns, and some specialized rescue, the PSAP shall ensure
the address, chief compliant, and safety instructions are immediately 
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3030
Page 2 of 3
included in the comments of the call notes and shall not delay EMS call
creation or response to the address of the emergency. For the Exclusive
Operating Area (EOA) contracted ambulance provider, all such calls that
cannot be immediately processed through MPDS shall be assigned a
Priority 2 response unless otherwise requested by first responders on
scene, law enforcement, or subsequent MPDS determinant.
4. Once a PSAP has completed their interrogation, if appropriate, they should
transfer the caller to a designated EMS Communications Center for MPDS
processing.
5. All initial, subsequent, or modified Public Safety/PSAP policies and procedures
related to this EMS System policy shall be made available to the EMS Agency
before implementation.
B. Non-Concurrence Public Safety/PSAP Medical Call Routing:
1. Public Safety/PSAPs shall develop and implement policies that ensure all Medical
Calls are properly identified and processed through MPDS procedures consistent
with EMS System polices.
2. Public Safety/PSAPs shall ensure all appropriate responders (Police, Fire, EMS)
receive the call simultaneously for proper assignment by their respective
dispatchers.
3. All initial, subsequent, or modified Public Safety/PSAP policies and procedures
related to this EMS System policy shall be made available to the EMS Agency
before implementation.
C. Concurrence and Non-Concurrence Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS
Communications Center Medical Call entry and MPDS:
1. The Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center shall
ensure that all Medical Calls include a problem nature protocol description
selected in CAD that corresponds exactly with the MPDS protocol numbers 1-33
descriptions.
2. The Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center shall
ensure that MPDS is used on all Medical Calls, including requests from medical
facilities to transport a patient to the emergency department (ED) (Card 33).
3. The Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center shall
ensure all available comments; including scene safety, and patient condition, are
documented in the call by the call taker or Emergency Medical Dispatcher and are
available, real time, for responders to view.
4. The Emergency Medical Dispatcher shall remain on the phone on all ECHO level,
and appropriate DELTA level calls, to provide post-dispatch instructions, prearrival instructions, or to maintain and monitor, until first responders are with the
patient.
D. Concurrence Public Safety/PSAP and/or designated EMS Communications Center
Medical Call Dispatch Process:
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3030
Page 3 of 3
1. Once Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center
identifies a call as a Medical Call, and an accurate location is identified, Public
Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center shall ensure the
call is created/generated in the CAD assignment queue simultaneously for Fire
first response and ambulance response.
2. All Medical Calls shall initially be created as a Priority 2 response for the EOA
contracted ambulance provider.
3. Once the Emergency Medical Dispatcher has assigned a MPDS determinant, the
EOA contracted ambulance provider response priority shall be modified by the
appropriate dispatcher, if necessary, based on the criteria in EMS System Policy
and Procedure 3050: MPDS Response Priorities and Assignments to EMS Calls.
4. Once an Emergency Medical Dispatcher has assigned a MPDS determinant, the
Emergency Medical Dispatcher shall immediately provide the updated
determinant to the first responder.
5. Any reduction or increase of an ambulance response priority to a Medical Call,
for any reason, shall be recorded so that upon request it is available to the EMS
Agency for accurate data analysis and response time calculations.

MPDS RESPONSE PRIORITIES AND RESOURCE ASSIGNMENTS TO
EMS CALLS
I. PURPOSE
To establish clinically-indicated response priorities and response planning for all emergency
medical calls using the Medical Priority Dispatch System™ (MPDS). The MPDS
determinants will drive response plans and priorities to reduce the unnecessary use of lights
and siren and will provide crucial data for EMS system review and Quality Improvement.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Response determinant methodology is defined by the International Academy of
Emergency Dispatch (IAED) in non-linear response levels based on Capability (BLS vs
ALS), single vs multiple resources, and Response Priorities based on the general acuity
of the patient and resources needed.
B. Response Levels (ECHO, DELTA, CHARLIE, BRAVO, ALPHA, and OMEGA) are
designated by the IAED and cannot be modified. However, for the EOA-contracted
ambulance provider, Capability, Response Priority, and Response Resources shall be
assigned by the EMS Medical Director or the EMS Agency.
C. Response Priorities and Resource Assignments are detailed below (see Table 1). The
EMS Medical Director may modify Response Priority and Response Resources to any
level or determinant as needed.
III. POLICY
A. Only designated EMS Communications Center(s) shall dispatch the EOA-contracted
ambulance provider, as specified in this policy.
B. A designated EMS Communications Center shall ensure that all medical calls will be
dispatched using a standard dispatch script.
C. The EOA-contracted ambulance provider response is subject to reassignment to a higher
priority call only if the following conditions exist, as determined by the Emergency
Medical Dispatcher (EMD):
a. The reassignment presents a clear and obvious time savings to the higher priority
call; OR
b. The diversion from the lower priority call will not subject unnecessary risk to the
lower priority patient.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3050
Page 2 of 4
D. Any EOA-contracted ambulance provider response is subject to upgrades or downgrades
of Priority as additional information is obtained or the patient’s condition changes, as
determined by MPDS or by first responders on scene. Upgrade of a Priority to lights and
siren is prohibited for the sole purpose of speeding up a perceived extended response by a
transport provider, unless the first responder on scene has determined the patient requires
immediate transport or ALS intervention.
E. EOA-contracted ambulance provider Response Resources and Response Priorities must
be approved by Local Medical Control (EMS Medical Director) and are subject to
internal EMS Agency review at any time. The EMS Medical Director may approve
modifications of Response Resources and/or Response Priorities based on other sources
including, but not limited to: QI processes, medical best practices, case studies, internal
review, and other sources.
Each fire department or fire district may determine their own Response Priorities to each type
of call. If a fire department or fire district chooses to use response plans and/or Response
Priorities that differ from EMS System policies, that fire department or fire district shall
submit its response plans to the EMS Agency.
G. Designated EMS Communications Center(s) shall be responsible to implement internal
Dispatch Review Committee (DRC) and/or Dispatch Steering Committee (DSC)
processes.
IV. RESPONSE ASSIGNMENTS
A. EOA-contracted ambulance provider Response Resources and Response Priorities shall
be built into the CAD in accordance with this policy and EMS Medical Director
approval.
B. Creation of the Medical Call Incident and routing to the dispatch queue for first response
and ambulance dispatch shall occur simultaneously as defined in EMS Agency Policy
3030.
C. Monterey County EMS Agency-approved MPDS Response Resources and Response
Priorities for chief complaint protocols are specified in Table 1.
a. CHARLIE and BRAVO response levels may indicate a single resource or
multiple resources based on recommended resource ETA.
b. BRAVO and ALPHA response levels may have BLS or ALS response
assignment based on recommended resource ETA.

Centers, ambulance-receiving hospitals, and the EMS Agency shall maintain and use
ReddiNet consistent with this policy.
B. Specialty Centers (Trauma, STEMI, and Stroke) will update their status on ReddiNet
when going on “advisory” status. They will update their status when they are no longer
on “advisory.”
C. Hospitals will update ReddiNet no less than every twenty-four (24) hours on a routine
basis for daily operations and may be required to update status information more often
during situations such as MCIs or disasters.
D. The Monterey County EMS Communications Center, other EMS Communications
Centers, ambulance-receiving hospitals, and the EMS Agency ReddiNet users shall
determine and manage the access to and use of ReddiNet within their organization.
E. Additional functions and modules (currently not being used) may be implemented in the
future – after collaborative discussion with EMS system stakeholders.
III. REDDINET USER ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
A. Monterey County EMS System participants have the following ReddiNet roles and
responsibilities:
1. All ReddiNet Users:
a. Maintain personnel on duty who can monitor, access, and change their
status on ReddiNet.
b. Participate in ReddiNet drills as required by policy.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3070
Page 2 of 3
2. Monterey County EMS Communications Center:
a. Monitor ReddiNet and alert ambulance crews and the Emergency
Communications Department (ECD) to changes in hospital and specialty
service availability.
b. Initiate “Actual” and “Drill” MCIs within ReddiNet.
c. Manage “Actual” MCIs within ReddiNet.
d. Alert and notify EMS Duty Officer of problems or unusual occurrences in
the EMS System or failure of ReddiNet.

b. Update their status on ReddiNet no less than every 24 hours during normal
operations.
c. Document facility advisories (Hospital Command Center activations) in
the Sit Rep/Comments section of ReddiNet.
d. ReddiNet will be monitored at all times by each hospital.
e. Hospitals will answer ReddiNet alerts, for both daily testing and actual
events, within five (5) minutes. Responses to Assessment Polls and
HavBED drills will be posted within twenty (20) minutes.
4. Other EMS Communication Centers (Communication Centers that dispatch other
ambulance providers and EMS first responders): Communications centers will
monitor ReddiNet and alert ambulance crews to changes in hospital and specialty
service availability and other system issues as appropriate.
5. EMS Agency: The EMS Agency Duty Officer will monitor ReddiNet as
necessary and indicate changes in the status of the EMS Medical Coordination
Center, Health Department Operating Center or Operational Area Emergency
Operations Center on ReddiNet.
IV. STATUS DESCRIPTIONS
A. The following status descriptions are used to identify facility and service status in
ReddiNet:
1. Available (Green): The facility is open to all patients and ambulances (open to
specialty patients in the case of Trauma, STEMI, or Stroke).
2. Unavailable (Red): The facility is in limited operational status due to a lack of
specialty resources; a temporary situation which impacts the reception of specialty
patients (STEMI, Stroke, Trauma).
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3070
Page 3 of 3
3. Closed (black): The facility is unavailable due to a “physical plant failure” such as
a power failure, flooding, evacuation, hazardous materials exposure or any other
cause that makes it impossible to receive patients or visitors. Note: when a
hospital declares a physical plant failure, they are closed to all patients, including
walk in patients, and are activating their HICS systems.
4. Unavailable is used only for specialty patients. This status cannot be used for
non-specialty patients. The closed or black status is used when the entire facility
is unable to receive patients or visitors.
5. Individual facilities can view information on the entire EMS system and specific
information on their individual facility. System administrators, such as the EMS
Agency and communications centers, have more access to specific facility
information.
B. Status of Hospital Command Center (HCC) activation. The two statuses for this tab are:
1. Yes (red): there is an active incident.
2. No (green): there are no active incidents (normal operational status).
V. REDDINET ACCESS CONTROL
A. Each organization shall determine which of their staff may access ReddiNet. This
responsibility includes creating and managing individual passwords for each authorized
user, providing training to authorized users, and assuring continuing competency in the
use of ReddiNet.
VI. USE OF REDDINET DURING CRITICAL INCIDENTS
A. During a significant event, such as an MCI or disaster, ReddiNet shall be used to alert
and communicate with hospitals and EMS communication centers. This includes alerts
sent by EMS communications centers to local facilities (i.e., ambulances transporting to
their facility from an MCI), alerts initiated by the facilities themselves (e.g., a physical
plant or safety issue), and polling of hospitals to determine their availability to receive
patients during an MCI or disaster. Limited patient tracking may also be accomplished
via ReddiNet. Use of additional capabilities/modules will be developed over time and
necessary training will take place before implementation (see II F).
VII. USE OF REDDINET DATA AS EMS PERFORMANCE MEASURES
A. The EMS Agency will use information from ReddiNet for quality improvement and
contract compliance purposes. This use includes monitoring the number of hours that
facilities or services have decreased availability and the results of communication tests.
B. This information will be considered EMS system performance metrics and will be
reported to EMS advisory committees.

HOSPITAL COMMUNICATIONS
PURPOSE:
To establish procedures for phone and radio communications between field personnel and hospital
personnel.
POLICY
A. This policy addresses procedures to be used in two types of hospital communication: base
hospital contact and hospital notification.
B. Base hospital contact is used by paramedic personnel to contact a Monterey County EMS
Agency-designated base hospital for the purpose of obtaining medical direction from a base
hospital physician.
1. Paramedic personnel shall make base hospital contact in the following circumstances:
a. To receive direction for administering medications or providing treatments that
are restricted by policy or protocol to base contact order only.
b. For a patient presenting with symptoms that cause uncertainty regarding the
appropriate protocol to be used.
c. To obtain a field pronouncement of death when the patient does not meet the
criteria listed in Policy #4100 (Pre-Hospital Determination of Death).
d. To perform Advanced Life Support (ALS) treatments or administer medications
not specifically authorized by Monterey County Policy and Protocol but that are
within the Monterey County paramedic scope of practice.
e. For consultation when:
1) The patient has a serious or potentially life-threatening condition but is
refusing care or transport, and base physician involvement may convince
the patient to accept the recommended treatment or transport.
2) There is disagreement among field providers regarding patient care. Refer
to Policy #4000 (Emergency Medical Scene Management).
3) The paramedic believes that base hospital physician involvement will
benefit patient care.
f. When required by Monterey County EMS System Policy.
2. Base contact is not the appropriate communication modality for discussion of the
patient’s condition with the base hospital physician, except as detailed above.
3. Base contact should be made to the designated specialty care center when needed as
outlined below:
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3080
Page 2 of 5
a. For patients meeting Step 1-3 Trauma Triage Criteria, contact Natividad. For
any questions related to the destination for adult and pediatric patients
meeting Step 4 trauma triage criteria, or for any patients who do not meet
trauma triage criteria, but whom the paramedic feels may benefit from a
trauma center, base hospital contact should be with Natividad.
b. For patients who are believed to be experiencing a stroke, contact the nearest
Monterey County EMS designated Stroke Center.
c. For patients who are believed to be experiencing an ST-Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (STEMI), contact the nearest Monterey County EMS designated
STEMI Receiving Center.
d. For ROSC in the adult,, contact the nearest STEMI Receiving Center.
4. Base hospital contact shall be with the receiving hospital if that hospital is also a base
hospital. If the receiving hospital is not a base hospital, contact the closest base hospital.
a. If the base hospital is not also the receiving hospital, the base hospital shall
contact the receiving hospital with a report on the patient and any orders given by
the base hospital.
5. In the event of base hospital communication failure, follow Monterey County EMS
System Policy #3091 (Base Hospital Communication Failure).
C. Hospital notification is used to contact the receiving hospital to advise the hospital of
impending patient arrival and condition. Most hospital communications will be hospital
notification only.
1. The purpose of hospital notification is to ensure that the hospital is prepared to receive
the patient with the appropriate bed, equipment, and personnel to care for the patient’s
condition.
2. These notifications should also include the proper specialty alert, in order to help the
receiving hospital prepare for the potential needs of the patient.
D. The minimum information to be communicated under base contact or hospital notification is
outlined in the procedure section of this policy.
PROCEDURE
A. Base hospital contact shall be made through a dedicated recorded radio channel or phone line.
B. Communication with a designated base hospital will start with specifying whether the
communication is for base contact or hospital notification.
C. Communications shall utilize the SBAR mnemonic, as below:
1. Situation
2. Background
3. Assessment
4. Recommendations/ Recap
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3080
Page 3 of 5
D. A full report should take 60 seconds or less, unless there are multiple patients or other mitigating
circumstances.
E. Paramedics shall repeat any orders given by a base hospital physician prior to closing
communication with the base hospital.

BASE HOSPTIAL COMMUNCIATION FAILURE
I. PURPOSE
To authorize the provision of medications and procedures that require base physician contact under
Monterey County EMS policies and protocols when voice communication with the base hospital
cannot be established or maintained and a delay in the treatment may jeopardize the life of a patient.
II. POLICY
A. In the event a paramedic is unable to establish or maintain voice contact with the Base Hospital
to obtain direction for treatments requiring base physician contact and reasonably determines that
a delay in treatment may jeopardize patient outcome, the paramedic may initiate any of the ALS

Registrant and legal counsel.
3. Discrepancy Reporting
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4012
Page 8 of 9
a. Each agency or service will follow its internal policy for reporting
discrepancies including tampering, theft, loss, or diversion of controlled
substances.
b. This policy will be established by the DEA Registrant and must include
immediate verbal reporting followed by written reports and investigation.
c. The DEA Registrant must notify the DEA of the discrepancy within one
business day of discovery using DEA Form 106, "Report of Theft or Loss
of Controlled Substances."
d. In addition, the EMS Agency must be notified within eight (8) hours
utilizing an Unusual Occurrence form as per policy # 6020.
4. Tampering, Theft and Diversion Prevention and Detection
a. Each agency or service’s internal policy regarding controlled substances
will comply with this policy; with the intent to prevent and detect the
tampering, theft, loss, and/or diversion of controlled substances.
b. Areas to be addressed include: ordering and order tracking, receipt and
accountability; master supply storage, security, and documentation;
labeling and tracking, vehicle storage and security, usage procedures and
documentation, reverse distribution, disposal, re-stocking procedures,
transfer or exchange of controlled substances between agencies and/or
services, controlled substance testing, discrepancy reporting; tampering,
theft and diversion prevention and detection; and usage audits.
c. Reporting the suspected tampering, theft, and/or diversion of controlled
substances to local law enforcement is required.
1) If the tampering, theft, and/or diversion of controlled substances is
substantiated, written reports must be made within eight (8) hours
to the EMS Agency and EMSA for action against the responsible
party’s certification, license, or accreditation.
5. Usage Audits
a. Each agency or service will follow its internal policy for usage audits.
These audits will:
1) Be conducted by the DEA registrant/designee
a) Any such designee must be authorized by the DEA
registrant and included on the agency or service’s roster of
personnel authorized to audit controlled substances
2) Account for the current disposition of all controlled substances
a) Include review of forms, purchase records, logs, and ePCRs
b) Identify and report discrepancies as required
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4012
Page 9 of 9
3) Identify and investigate unusually high rates of administration
a) Establish a baseline for the rate of controlled substance
administration among all individuals authorized to
administer controlled substances during the time-period
being audited
b) Identify high outliers, individuals with high rates of
controlled substance administration
c) Review each administration of controlled substances
performed by these high outliers for accountability and
clinical appropriateness
4) Be performed at least quarterly
b. Records of these audits will be:
1) Maintained at and/or electronically accessible from the agency or
service’s quality assurance location
2) Available for inspection within 24 hours by the EMS Agency
3) Maintained for a period of no less than two years
6. Biennial On-Hand Inventory
a. In addition to daily and other routine running inventories, the DEA
requires a separate Biennial On-Hand Inventory. This inventory includes
all controlled substances, including those in a central facility and those
which have been deployed. It also includes those in the reverse
distribution process. It is a “snapshot” count in time. These counts should
be scheduled by every provider in such a way that they are not forgotten.

PRE-HOSPITAL CONSENT AND REFUSAL OF
SERVICE/CARE
I. PURPOSE
To establish guidelines for obtaining consent to prehospital medical treatment or
transportation, and for dealing with patients who are unable or unwilling to give their
consent.
II. POLICY
General Principles: A person is deemed to have decision-making capacity if they have the
ability to provide informed consent. This requires that the person meet the following criteria:
A. Is an adult (18 years or older) or, if under 18, is legally emancipated.
B. Oriented to person, place, time, and situation.
C. Understands the nature of the illness/injury or risk of injury/illness.
D. Understands the possible risks and consequence of delaying treatment and/or refusing
transport.
E. Exhibits no evidence of intoxication with alcohol and/or drugs.
III. PROCEDURE: REFUSAL OF CARE
Applies to patients who by direct examination, mechanism of injury, or by initiating a patient
relationship by dialing 9-1-1 for medical care for themselves, are refusing medical care
and/or transportation.
A. If the patient is legally and mentally capable of refusing evaluation, treatment, and/or
transport:
1. Reasonable effort should be made to convince the patient to agree to accept the
proposed medical treatment and transport. However, a competent
adult/emancipated minor has the legal right to refuse care.
2. Advise the patient of all risks associated with refusal.
3. Have the patent sign the Release of Medical Responsibility form. A witness shall
also sign. It is preferable to have a relative, friend of the patient, other bystander,
or responder from a separate agency sign as a witness.
4. Consider contacting the Base Hospital for assistance if the patient has a
potentially life-threatening condition, if there is uncertainty about the patient’s
capacity to make medical decisions, or if Base Hospital participation is thought to
be beneficial in convincing the patient to accept the proposed medical care or 
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4030
Page 2 of 4
transport. In these instances, Base Hospital consultation should be directed
towards the specific issues or questions that may impact decision-making and
patient care.
5. Complete a PCR detailing the circumstances of the refusal of care.
B. If the patient is not legally and mentally capable of refusing evaluation, treatment, and/or
transport, determine if an authorized person is available to give consent for the patient.
1. If the authorized representative consents to the proposed medical care, treat and
transport accordingly.
2. If the authorized representative refuses to give consent, follow the process
outlined above for refusal of care and/or transport, having the authorized
representative sign a written refusal of care and/or transport on behalf of the
patient.
3. If the authorized representative is not available, initiate care considered
appropriate for the patient’s needs and attempt to contact an authorized
representative.
4. If the patient does not appear to need immediate care or transport, attempt to
contact the authorized representative prior to starting patient care or transport.
This should be done within a reasonable timeframe.
5. If contact with the authorized representative is unavailable, treat the patient under
implied consent.
6. Complete a PCR detailing the circumstances of the refusal of care.
IV. PROCEDURE: REFUSAL OF SERVICE
Refusal of service applies to those individuals with whom no patient-caregiver relationship
has been established and no direct examination of the individual has occurred because the
individual is refusing all EMS services, including an offer of assessment and transportation if
warranted.
A. BLS and ALS personnel may honor a refusal of service.
B. The individual must meet all of the following criteria:
1. Is an adult (18 years or older), or if less than 18 years old, is legally emancipated.
2. Exhibits no evidence of altered level of consciousness or intoxication from
alcohol or drugs.
3. Declines evaluation for potential illness or injury.
C. Actions to be taken include the following:
1. Honor the refusal.
2. Complete a PCR detailing the circumstances of the refusal of service.
3. If multiple individuals at one event refuse service, document each name on one
PCR. It is not necessary to complete a separate PCR for each individual who
refuses service.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4030
Page 3 of 4
V.NOTES
A. A minor who presents written evidence of legal emancipation can personally refuse
prehospital medical treatment as described above. This evidence can be either a written
Declaration of Emancipation from the County Superior Court, or an Identification Card
from the Department of Motor Vehicles indicating emancipation.
B. A person detained under California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5150, or
someone under arrest, does not, by that fact alone, lose the authority to make decisions
regarding prehospital medical treatment. No person may be presumed to lack capacity
solely because they have been evaluated or treated for mental disorder, regardless of
whether such evaluation or treatment was voluntarily or involuntarily received.
C. If a patient is treated or transported without consent, based on the belief that the patient
lacked sufficient capacity to make a healthcare decision, then patient care documentation
must reflect the reason or reasons for this belief and show why this belief was reasonable.

FIELD TRAUMA TRIAGE CRITERIA
I. PURPOSE
A. The Adult and Pediatric Field Trauma Triage Algorithms are designed to guide the EMS
provider in identifying the Major Trauma Patient and determining the appropriate destination. It
uses a four-step decision process to determine the potential for injury severity and whether it is
likely that the patient would benefit from Trauma Center level of service.
II. POLICY
A. All patients who have sustained trauma will be evaluated using the Field Trauma Triage
Decision Algorithm.
B. Trauma patient destination shall be determined in accordance with the Field Trauma Triage
Decision Algorithm appropriate to the patient’s age.
C. Patients determined to have an unmanageable airway shall be transported to the closest
Emergency Department (ED).
D. For patients meeting trauma triage criteria, EMS crews should limit on-scene time to 10 minutes
whenever possible.
E. Pediatric Major Trauma Patients (less than age 15) meeting Step 1 and/or Step 2 criteria are to be
flown to the closest designated Pediatric Trauma Center. If the patient cannot be flown for any
reason (e.g., parental refusal, helicopters unable to fly), transport directly to the closest Trauma
Center (TC).
F. All other trauma patients shall be transported via ground ambulance unless such transport is
unavailable or if ground transport is significantly longer than air transport, and this difference in
time may negatively impact the patient's condition. See EMS Aircraft Operations policy.
G. Base hospital contact with Natividad Medical Center shall be made when considering
transporting an Adult or Pediatric trauma patient who meets Step 1, 2, or 3 criteria to a different
facility than is directed by the Field Trauma Triage Decision Algorithm.
H. Consider sending adult family members to the same trauma center as their children when both
adult and child family members meet trauma criteria. Adult family members who sustain
injuries but do not meet trauma criteria and have a child or children who do meet trauma criteria
may be transported to the same hospital as their children.
I. This policy is not intended to guide mass casualty events. See the Monterey County EMS
Multiple Casualty Incident (MCI) Response Plan.
III. PROCEDURE
Use the following Field Triage Decision Algorithm to help determine the destination for trauma
patients:

Natividad rather than transporting the patient away from Natividad should air transport
become unavailable.
E. Patients requiring emergency airway management that cannot be successfully performed
by EMS or EMS Aircraft providers shall be transported to the closest, most accessible
emergency department.
F. Base hospital contact with Natividad is mandatory if initial rendezvous is aborted or
redirected.
IV. PATIENT DESTINATION DECISIONS, MEDICAL PATIENTS
A. Air transport should be considered when the anticipated transport time by ground exceeds
45 minutes. Anticipated transport times must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The
decision must consider travel times, weather, road conditions, traffic volume, availability
and location of air ambulance resources, and other pertinent factors.
B. When possible, the LZ should be established in a location that is closer to a local hospital
rather than transporting the patient away from a local hospital should air transport
become unavailable.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4070
Page 3 of 6
C. Patients in extremis or with an uncontrolled airway shall be transported to the closest,
most accessible emergency department.
V. PROCEDURES
A. Activation Outside the Urban Response Zone: Units responding to an incident may, prior
to arrival at scene, request the response of an EMS Aircraft should they believe
conditions such as distance make it likely that the EMS Aircraft will be able to respond
faster than ground resources or the patient’s condition requires EMS Aircraft response.
B. EMS Aircraft Dispatch:
1. EMS Aircraft will be dispatched based on the criteria listed above.
2. All requests for EMS Aircraft shall be made through the County of Monterey
Emergency Communications Department (ECD) or by the CALFIRE Dispatch
Center through the ECD.
C. The following information shall be given to the ECD when requesting EMS Aircraft:
1. Agency name and dispatch frequency of agency requesting helicopter;
2. Location and the number of patient(s);
3. Type and extent of injuries, if known;
4. Request for a hoist or other specialized capabilities, if needed;
5. Designated Landing Zone;
6. General location of nearest landing site (Thomas Bros. Page and GPS coordinates
and/or significant landmarks identifiable from the air); and,
7. General weather/visibility conditions.
D. The ECD shall request an estimated time of arrival (ETA) when notified that an EMS
aircraft will accept the mission. This ETA shall be provided to the Incident Commander.
E. EMS Aircraft should not accept a mission unless there is the reasonable expectation that
they will be able to complete the transport to the destination hospital. Factors including
weather, fuel, or other considerations shall be taken into account.
F. Communications:
1. The ECD shall request the closest EMS Aircraft be dispatched unless the Incident
Commander determines the use of a Rescue Aircraft is appropriate.
2. The ECD shall advise all responding ground and air units of EMS Aircraft
dispatch, estimated time of arrival, radio frequency, and/or cancellation.
3. CALCORD is the preferred channel for ground-to-helicopter communication.
The Incident Commander or designee, in consultation with the ECD, can identify
other radio frequencies to be used.
4. The EMS Aircraft shall contact the ECD when enroute to the scene to ascertain
the radio frequency and contact person to be used for air-to-ground
communication.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4070
Page 4 of 6
5. The EMS Aircraft shall notify the receiving facility of their impending arrival as
soon as possible prior to arrival. This notification is to include patient
information and an ETA.
6. EMS Aircraft providers shall notify the ECD if a Monterey County ground
ambulance is needed from the terminal airport or LZ to the receiving hospital.
7. Ambulance crews may talk directly with fire crews for coordination of EMS
Aircraft requests. The ECD shall advise the EMS Aircraft Dispatch Center(s) if
multiple aircraft are providing support to the incident.
G. Cancellation of EMS Aircraft/Ground Providers
1. The responding ground ambulance shall not be canceled until the EMS Aircraft
has departed the scene with the patient on board. Only the Incident Commander
may cancel the EMS Aircraft. This decision should be made after consultation
with the ground ALS provider and when it is determined that transport is no
longer needed or ground transport is appropriate.
2. The Incident Commander’s decision to cancel the requested EMS Aircraft should
be based upon the total pre-hospital time from dispatch to arrival at the hospital,
patient’s medical condition, severity of injury, and/or safety and environmental
conditions.
3. The EMS Aircraft crew may transfer responsibility for patient care to a ground
ambulance if no interventions beyond the Monterey County Paramedic Scope of
Practice have been utilized, and if both parties are in agreement.
H. Air and Ground Ambulance Rendezvous:
1. In the event that an EMS Aircraft is unable to land at the scene, consideration
shall be given by the Incident Commander or designee to arrange for a
rendezvous at a pre-designated LZ. The ground ALS transport provider shall be
consulted.
2. Following Initiation of Ambulance Transport:
a) If patient transport is initiated by the ground ambulance but original
ground ETA becomes extended, rendezvous at an approved LZ may be
initiated by ambulance personnel when (1) patient condition deteriorates,
(2) traffic conditions are prohibitive, or (3) unit develops mechanical
failure. Monterey County Emergency Communications Center shall be
notified.
b) If circumstances preclude EMS Aircraft from landing at an approved LZ,
the ground ALS transport provider should request a public safety agency
response to assist in securing and preparing the selected LZ.
3. Only personnel trained in EMS Aircraft landing procedures shall be utilized to
determine the LZ and assist in landing the EMS Aircraft.
I. Medical Control
1. Each EMS Aircraft provider shall have a designated Flight Medical Director.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4070

helicopter safety and landing procedures.
2. Scene security is of prime importance. The agency coordinating the landing shall
ensure the LZ is secure and safe.
3. The EMS Aircraft pilot shall have final authority as to the safe operation of the air
transport. If the pilot deems that patient transport by EMS Aircraft would be
unsafe, the patient will be transported by ground ambulance.
4. Ground personnel shall not approach the EMS Aircraft unless directed to do so by
EMS Aircraft crew. When approaching or departing the helicopter, ground
personnel shall not lift anything higher than their head nor shall they at any time
approach or depart a helicopter from the rear or from the uphill side when the
aircraft is landed on a slope.
5. Hats, helmets, turnouts, or any loose items are to be secured or removed prior to
approaching the helicopter. Any removable objects shall be stripped from the
gurney when approaching the helicopter.

END OF LIFE CARE
I. PURPOSE
To establish criteria that recognizes and accommodates a patient’s designated end of life
choices and directives in order to limit prehospital treatment by Emergency Medical Services
(EMS) field personnel in the prehospital setting. This policy applies to both adult and
pediatric patients.
II. POLICY
A. The underlying principle in End of Life Care is to abide by the patient’s wishes. In some
circumstances, conflict may arise between the expressed wishes of the patient and the
wishes of the family. EMS personnel should seek clarification from the applicable
Monterey County EMS System’s Policies and Protocols, the Base Hospital, and/or the
patient’s legally recognized decision maker, as needed.
All patients with rapidly deteriorating vital signs or absent vital signs, who do not meet
the criteria for Determination of Death, shall be treated with resuscitative measures
unless EMS personnel are presented with valid end of life care documentation (Advance
Directive), as described below. A request to withhold resuscitation by an individual
named as “Attorney-In-Fact” in a Durable Powers of Attorney Health Care Directive
(Advance Directive) shall also cause resuscitation to be withheld.
B. The patient can rescind any Advance Directive or End of Life Care Act option at any
time.
III. END OF LIFE CARE DOCUMENTATION (Advance Directive)
A. Forms related to patient’s end of life instructions that EMS field personnel may encounter
include:
1. Statewide EMSA/California Medical Association (CMA) Prehospital DNR form.
2. POLST form.
3. DNR medallion, bracelet or necklace.
4. A Do Not Resuscitate Order in a patient’s chart dated and signed by the
physician.
5. End of Life Options Act Directive and/or Final Attestation for an Aid-in-Dying
Drug to End My Life in a Humane and Dignified Manner (Final Attestation)
form.
B. The most recent Advance Directive shall be considered the prevailing documentation.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4120
Page 2 of 4
C. Forms other than those listed above do not provide direction to EMS personnel but may
help in understanding the patient’s wishes.
IV. VALIDATION CRITERIA
A. EMS Prehospital DNR
1. The EMS Prehospital DNR form should include the following to be considered
valid:
a. Patient’s name.
b. Signature of the patient or a legally recognized decision maker if the
patient is unable to make or communicate informed healthcare decisions.
c. Signature of patient’s physician, affirming that the patient/legal
representative has given informed consent to the DNR instruction.
d. All signatures must be dated.
e. Correct identification of the patient is crucial. If the patient is unable to be
identified after a good faith attempt to identify the patient, a reliable
witness may be used to identify the patient.
f. In licensed healthcare facilities, a DNR order written by a physician shall
be honored.
1) The staff must have the patient’s chart with the DNR order
immediately available for EMS field personnel upon their arrival.
2) The order may contain the words “Do Not Resuscitate”, “No
CPR”, or “No Code” and contain the patient’s name and the date
and signature of the physician.
B. DNR Medallion, Bracelet or Necklace
1. The DNR medallion/bracelet/necklace is made of metal with a permanently
imprinted medical insignia. For the medallion or bracelet/necklace to be valid,
the following applies:
a. Patient must be physically wearing the DNR medallion/bracelet/necklace.
b. Medallion/bracelet/necklace must be engraved with the words, “Do Not
Resuscitate EMS” or “California POLST EMS”, along with a toll-free
emergency information telephone number and a patient identification
number.
C. Physician Order for Life Saving Treatment (POLST)
1. The POLST should be reviewed along with other documents if available to ensure
clarity of the patient’s wishes. The POLST:
a. Must be signed and dated by a physician, nurse practitioner or physician
assistant acting under the supervision of a physician and within the scope
of practice authorized by law.
b. Must be signed by the patient or decision maker.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4120
Page 3 of 4
c. Is not valid without signatures. Verbal or telephone orders are acceptable
with follow-up signature by the physician in accordance with
facility/community policy. There should be a box checked indicating who
the authorized healthcare provider discussed the POLST orders with. By
signing the form, the healthcare provider acknowledges that these orders
are consistent with the patient’s medical condition and preferences.
D. End of Life Care Options Act
1. A terminally ill and competent patient may elect to obtain medications to hasten
their imminent death at a time and place of their choosing. They must satisfy
extensive and stringent requirements as required by California law to obtain an
Aid-in-Dying Drug and complete a “Final Attestation for an Aid-In-Dying Drug
to End My Life in a Humane and Dignified Manner” within 48 hours prior to selfadministration.
2. There are no standardized Final Attestation forms, but the law has required
specific information that must be in the final attestation. If available, EMS field
personnel should make a good faith effort to review and verify that the final
attestation contains the following information:
a. The document is identified as a “Final Attestation for an Aid-In-Dying
Drug to End My Life in a Humane and Dignified Manner.”
b. Patient’s name, signature and date.
c. EMS field personnel should review and verify that the Final Attestation is
present.
d. Correctly identifies the patient’s name and is signed and dated by the
patient.
e. EMS field personnel should confirm the patient is the person named in the
Final Attestation. This will require either the presence of a form of
identification or a witness who can reliably identify the patient.
f. The Final Attestation must be completed within 48 hours prior to taking
the medications.
g. Obtain a copy of the Final Attestation and attach it to the electronic patient
care record (ePCR) whenever possible.
h. There is no mandate for the patient to maintain the Final Attestation in
close proximity to the patient.
V. End of Life Care Guidelines
A. In addition to the validation criteria, the following guidelines are provided for EMS field
personnel when responding to a patient with Standardized Patient-Designated Directives:
1. The POLST may be used for both adult and pediatric patients.
2. EMS personnel shall contact a Base Hospital for direction if a DNR or POLST
cannot be validated. While EMS personnel are contacting the base hospital for 
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4120
Page 4 of 4
direction, BLS treatment must be initiated and continued. If contact cannot be
made, resuscitative efforts shall continue.
3. The End of Life Care Options Act Final Attestation form is legal and binding. No
surrogate decision making is permitted. In the event of suspicious circumstances
surrounding the Final Attestation, EMS personnel should make Base Hospital
contact.
4. When presented with a valid DNR or POLST Order, efforts at resuscitation will
not be started. If a valid DNR or POLST order is discovered once resuscitative
measures are in progress, those measures will be discontinued.
5. EMS field personnel shall attach a copy of the validated DNR or POLST form to
the patient care record, along with any other appropriate written documentation
when available. The DNR form should accompany the patient to the hospital so
that it may be incorporated into the medical record at the receiving facility.
a. When DNR orders are noted in medical records in licensed facilities, that
fact should be recorded by the EMS provider, along with the date of the
order and the physician’s name. It should be noted on the ePCR that a
written DNR order was present including the name of the physician, date
signed and other appropriate information.
6. If a patient dies at home and the patient is not under the care of Hospice, law
enforcement must be notified. In all cases, the Coroner must be notified.
7. Other Advance Healthcare Directives - Living Wills. There are a variety of
“Living Wills” available from many sources. These documents may help give
EMS providers an idea of the patient’s wishes, but due to the many different
formats, they are not suitable as a DNR document in the prehospital environment.
The Base Hospital may elect to use these in guiding patient care efforts.
VI. SUPPORTIVE MEASURES
A. Unless a patient is actively dying, medical treatment for other conditions should not be
withheld.
B. Comfort Measures Only directions in a POLST may be followed if within the scope of
practice of the prehospital EMS provider. Comfort measures that will need to be
continued or repeated in the hospital should result in patient transport.
C. Involve law enforcement and the Coroner to assist with disposition of deceased patients
who are not under hospice care.
D. Consider supportive organizations for family members at the scene: Chaplaincy services,
advocacy groups, and other family support can aid in the grieving process.

AIRWAY MANAGEMENT
I. PURPOSE
To establish procedures for Monterey County Emergency Medical prehospital personnel in
managing adult and pediatric airways.
II. POLICY
A. Management of the patient’s airway is to follow the guidance contained in this policy.
B. The airway should be managed with the least invasive procedure that is adequate to
maintain an open airway and allows adequate pulmonary ventilation. End-Tidal CO2
reading should be less than 60 (when capnography is used) to ensure adequate pulmonary
ventilation.
C. BLS personnel trained to the First Responder or EMT level may utilize suctioning, nasalpharyngeal and oral-pharyngeal airways, and bag-valve-mask devices to maintain
ventilation and airway. EMT-Expanded Scope authorized personnel may also use
approved adult supraglottic airways.
D. ALS personnel may use all approved BLS methods and equipment, laryngoscopy, Magill
forceps, endotracheal tubes, supraglottic airways, and needle cricothyrotomy to provide
ventilation and airway management.
E. Correct placement of an endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway must be confirmed by
auscultation for the presence of lung sounds, the absence of epigastric sounds, and
through the use of capnography.
F. No more than 2 attempts at endotracheal intubation shall be made on any patient without
base hospital physician approval.
G. No more than 2 attempts at supraglottic airway placement shall be made on any patient
without base hospital physician approval.
H. ALS Service Providers shall report the number of intubation and supraglottic airway
attempts and the number of successful intubations and supraglottic airway placements
monthly to the EMS Medical Director. Nasotracheal intubation is not an approved skill in
Monterey County.
I. Attempts at endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway placement should not take
longer than 30 seconds. CPR, if being performed, should not be interrupted for longer
than 10 seconds for tube placement.
J. Methods to confirm endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway placement are to be
documented on the PCR.
K. A cervical collar should be placed after endotracheal intubation to help limit head
movement and possible tube displacement.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4502
Page 2 of 2
L. Needle cricothyrotomy is a rarely utilized but potentially life-saving intervention that can
be performed to establish a patent airway for adult and pediatric patients (greater than 1
year of age) with a complete airway obstruction that cannot be resolved using less-invasive
techniques. Needle cricothyrotomy is contraindicated if the patient can either breathe
spontaneously or can be adequately ventilated. Since establishment of an airway is critical
to patient survival, up to three attempts may be performed by ALS providers if needed.
III. PROCEDURE
A. See Protocol R-1 Airway Management for adult patients.
B. See Protocol RP-1 Airway Management-Pediatric for pediatric patients.

F. Signs and symptoms of pneumothorax
G. Major facial, head, neck, or chest trauma
H. Inability to maintain airway patency
I. Facial anomalies that prevent adequate mask seal
J. Possible transmissible airborne infectious disease (COVID, TB, etc.)
K. Vomiting or active GI bleeding
L. Stomach surgery (including gastric sleeve) within the past month
RELATIVE Contraindications (USE WITH CAUTION)
A. History of pulmonary fibrosis
B. History of pneumothorax
C. Claustrophobia or unable to tolerate mask (after coaching attempt and a two-minute trial)
V. PROCEDURE
A. Prior to applying the CPAP device, explain the treatment and inform the patient of what
to anticipate. The patient should be either sitting (preferred) or standing upright when
utilizing the CPAP. Approach the patient slowly with the mask and hold it a few
centimeters away from their face prior to application and securing the head straps.
B. Follow the manufacturer’s directions for set up and placement of the CPAP device.
Make sure that oxygen is flowing prior to placing the mask over the patient’s face and
securing the head straps. If air is leaking from the face seal, assess the cause and readjust
either the mask positioning or tension on the head straps. Consider changing the mask
size if necessary.
C. Start CPAP at 7.5 cm H2O. The provider may increase the pressure up to 10 cm H2O
based on the patient’s presentation. Base hospital contact shall be obtained to adjust the
pressure > 10 cm H2O.
D. In-line nebulization may be used with the CPAP circuit to administer a bronchodilator
during CPAP use.
E. Monitor and document vital signs (BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, SPO2, cardiac rhythm,
and ETCO2) and patient response to treatment every 5 minutes.
F. Observe for signs of deterioration or failure of patient response to CPAP.

DROWNING AND NON-FATAL DROWNING
I. PURPOSE
To define the principles of care for drowning, non-fatal drowning, and diving emergencies.
II. POLICY
A. EMS personnel are to follow employer policy regarding water rescue.
B. Routine use of a backboard is discouraged except as needed for extrication and patient
movement. Spinal Motion Restriction should be considered for mechanism of injury
such as diving into shallow water.
III. PROCEDURE
A. Ensure scene and rescuer safety. Call appropriate public safety agencies: fire, rescue, or
police teams, including scuba teams to properly stabilize the scene and safely rescue the
victim(s) from the source of submersion. Consider need for additional EMS unit(s) for
rescuer rehabilitation and/or treatment.
B. Maintain an open airway immediately upon obtaining access to the patient. Ensure spinal
stabilization and immobilization if indicated (i.e., un-witnessed event, unconscious
patient, or mechanism of injury). Assist ventilations as needed.
C. Determine patient’s hemodynamic stability and symptoms. Continually assess Level of
Consciousness, ABCs and Vital Signs. Treat all life-threatening conditions as they
become identified. Initiate CPR when appropriate.
D. The following guidelines should be used by EMS providers to guide their decision about
whether to perform CPR on drowning victims with prolonged submersion:
1. Submersion less than 90 minutes in water less than 43 degrees Fahrenheit: Begin
CPR and transport.
2. Submersion greater than 90 minutes in water less than 43 degrees Fahrenheit:
CPR may be withheld.
3. Submersion less than 30 minutes in water greater than 43 degrees Fahrenheit:
Begin CPR and transport.
4. Submersion greater than 30 minutes in water greater than 43 degrees Fahrenheit:
CPR may be withheld.
5. If the submersion time is unknown and there are no obvious findings incompatible
with life (e.g., advanced decomposition, separation of vital organs from the body),
begin CPR and transport.
2
6. Initiate CPR for cardiac arrest for scuba diving emergencies unless time of arrest
can be determined.
E. If near-drowning incident involves a scuba diver, suggesting barotrauma, consider
utilization of hyperbaric treatment facility.
F. For viable patients and those receiving CPR, initiate transport as soon as possible.
G. Encourage the patient to accept transport after a non-fatal drowning due to the potential
for delayed respiratory problems.

8. Remove the stylet from the catheter.
9. Confirm placement of the catheter by flushing the catheter with 10 cc normal
saline.
10. Consider the administration of Lidocaine (2% solution) 20 mg IO for the adult or
0.5 mg/kg (up to 20 mg) IO for the pediatric patient who is conscious and
complains of pain at the insertion site.
11. Attach IV tubing to the IO device.
12. Flush catheter with 10 cc normal saline. Check for signs of extravasation (soft
tissue swelling or difficulty infusing fluids through the catheter). Begin normal
saline infusion or medication administration. Consider use of pressure device to
provide rapid infusion of fluids, if needed.
13. Dress insertion site, stabilize and secure the catheter.
Monterey County EMS Agency Policy 4505

9. Grasp and stabilize the trachea between the thumb and middle finger of your nondominant hand. Locate the cricothyroid membrane with the index finger of your
non-dominant hand by palpating the depression between the inferior aspect of the
thyroid cartilage and the superior aspect of the cricoid cartilage. This is the
location of the cricothyroid membrane.
10. Puncture the cricothyroid membrane with the Quicktrach II needle tip and
catheter while positioning the needle and catheter at a 90-degree angle to the
plane of the skin.
11. Once the needle tip has punctured the cricothyroid membrane, change the angle of
insertion of the needle and catheter to a 45-degree angle and advance the catheter
caudally (toward the patient’s feet) until the red stopper is against the patient’s
skin.
12. Aspirate air with the attached syringe to confirm that the needle tip and catheter
are within the trachea. If you cannot aspirate air through the attached syringe, reposition the catheter and try again. If you still cannot aspirate air, remove the
catheter and try again, repeating the steps above. If air cannot be aspirated
following two additional attempts (3 total attempts), remove the device, continue
attempted ventilation with a BVM, and transport.
13. Once air can be aspirated with the attached syringe, remove the red stopper and
advance the plastic cannula over the needle until the green safety clip audibly
clicks into position.
14. Continue to advance the device until the plastic flange is flush with the skin.
15. Stabilize the plastic flange with your non-dominant hand, remove the metal
needle from the cannula, and dispose of the needle in the sharps container.
16. Inflate the distal cuff with air using the prepared syringe in the Quicktrach II kit.

PLEURAL DECOMPRESSION
I. PURPOSE
To authorize and provide guidance allowing paramedics to provide pleural decompression
for the patient with signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax or traumatic cardiac arrest
with evidence of chest trauma.
II. POLICY
A. Pleural decompression is indicated for patients with:
1. Clinical signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax and rapidly deteriorating
vital signs, OR
2. Traumatic cardiac arrest with evidence of chest trauma.
B. The preferred site for pleural decompression is the second (2nd) intercostal space at the
midclavicular line on the affected side.
C. If a patient’s anatomy or other factors make it difficult to access the midclavicular
approach, an alternative site for pleural decompression in patients 15 years or older is the
fourth or fifth (4th or 5th) intercostal space at the midaxillary line. The insertion site for
pediatric patients (age less than 15) is restricted to the 2nd intercostal space at the
midclavicular line.
D. Patients in traumatic cardiac arrest with evidence of chest trauma should undergo
bilateral pleural decompressions in the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
E. Only one attempt on the affected side shall be made without Base Physician order. In
the event that the first catheter occludes, a second attempt can be made without base
contact.
III. CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX
A. Clinical signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax include a combination of the
following (not all signs may not be present):
1. Severe respiratory distress
2. Diminished breath sounds on the affected side
3. Tracheal deviation away from the affected side
4. Tachycardia
5. Altered Level of Consciousness
6. Jugular vein distention
7. Hypotension
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4507
Page 2 of 3
IV. PROCEDURE
A. Procedure for pleural decompression:
1. Draw up 5-6 mL of normal saline into a 10 mL syringe and attach the syringe to a
10-14 gauge IV catheter. (For patients 15 years and older, the catheter length
should be 2.5 - 3.25 inches.)
2. Palpate the appropriate intercostal space and clean the insertion site with
Betadine, alcohol preps, or chlorhexidine.
3. Insert the 10-14 gauge IV catheter (with attached syringe) above the rib and
perpendicular to the appropriate intercostal space. Advance the catheter while
pulling back gently on the plunger of the syringe. If a tension pneumothorax
exists, air will start to fill the syringe when the catheter has entered the pleural
space.
4. Advance the catheter over the needle and remove the needle and syringe from the
catheter.
5. Attach a one-way valve (flutter valve or other appropriate device) to the catheter.
6. Secure the catheter and one-way valve.
V. NOTES
Pleural decompression for pediatric patients (age less than 15) experiencing a tension
pneumothorax with rapidly deteriorating vital signs should be performed using a 1.5-inch
(3.8-cm) 14-16 gauge IV catheter with attached syringe. Insertion site for pediatric patients
is restricted to the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
Assure that the tension pneumothorax is not caused by an occlusive dressing already applied
to the patient. Allow air to escape from the dressed wound prior to using needle
decompression.
When performing a pleural decompression at the 4
th or 5th intercostal space in the
midaxillary line, there is a risk of perforating intra-abdominal organs if the needle is inserted
too low. Needle insertion should be performed superior to the nipple line in men and
superior to the inframammary fold in women. In adults, the correct insertion site is roughly
one hand-width below the axilla (see photo below).

USE OF RESTRAINTS
I. PURPOSE:
To establish standards for the use of restraints.
II. POLICY:
The following principles shall be followed when utilizing patient restraints:
A. Restraints shall be humanely and professionally applied to protect the patient’s safety and
dignity.
B. The method of restraint should be the least restrictive necessary for the safety of the
patient and others.
C. The use of restraints shall be thoroughly documented. Documentation shall include the
reason(s) for use of restraints, type of restraints used, what limbs are placed in restraints,
the use of sedation (if applicable), and regular assessments of the restrained patient.
D. Assessments of the restrained patient shall be conducted and documented at least every
15 minutes. Documentation shall include the patient’s level of consciousness,
respirations, and distal perfusion to any restrained extremities.
E. Patients SHALL NOT be restrained in a prone position.
III. PROCEDURE:
Patients who meet one or more of the following criteria shall be restrained to the gurney
utilizing a minimum of two-point restraints.
• Patients who have been placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold (referred to herein as a
“5150 hold”).
• Patients who present a potential danger to themselves or others as determined by EMS
personnel, law enforcement, emergency department staff, or other prehospital personnel.
• Patients who require medical attention and are in law enforcement custody.
Unless contraindicated by an upper extremity amputation or injury, acceptable two-point
restraints include application of a restraint to both wrists. If an amputation or injury makes it
not feasible to place both wrists in restraints, then at least one wrist and one ankle shall be
placed in restraints.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4508
Page 2 of 3
When transporting a patient in restraints, EMS personnel shall ensure the following:
A. NEVER RESTRAIN A PATIENT IN A PRONE POSITION. Restrained patients
shall be placed in a supine, semi-Fowler’s, or Fowler's position. Patients shall never
be transported in a prone or "hog-tied" position.
B. Only restrain patients in a manner that allows for rapid access to the airway, rapid
initiation of CPR, and full expansion of the patient’s chest during respirations.
C. In addition to restraints, all patients shall be secured to the gurney utilizing all
appropriate standard safety belts.
D. The patient shall be securely restrained to the gurney PRIOR to placing the patient in
the ambulance.
E. Patient safety buckles and restraints shall be clearly visible and continually monitored by
the attending EMS provider at all times during the course of transport.
F. Patients shall remain in restraints for the duration of the transport.
G. Except for brief removal of restraints to enable a patient to utilize the bathroom during a
long-distance transport, restraints shall not be removed until the patient is safely inside
the receiving facility and patient care has been transferred to the receiving facility staff.
H. The use of chemical sedation DOES NOT satisfy the need for application of physical
restraints. Patients who have been chemically sedated due to dangerous, aggressive, or
unpredictable behavior shall also be placed in restraints for the duration of the transport.
I. Patient restraints shall never be imposed as a means of coercion, discipline,
convenience, or retaliation.
IV. PATIENTS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT CUSTODY
Patients in law enforcement custody who require EMS transport shall either be transported in
restraints or handcuffed by a law enforcement officer.
A. Patients who are handcuffed require a law enforcement officer to accompany the patient
in the back of the ambulance during transport to the receiving facility. EMS personnel
are not authorized to use handcuffs or manage the restraint of a patent placed in
handcuffs.
Patients who are restrained with EMS restraints (not handcuffs) do not require the presence
of a law enforcement officer in the back of the ambulance during transport to the receiving
facility.
V. PATIENT ESCAPE:
Should a patient escape from restraints and exit the ambulance, the following steps should be
initiated:
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4508
Page 3 of 3
A. Do everything possible to minimize injury to EMS personnel and the patient.
B. Contact EMS Communications immediately and advise them of the situation, location,
and status of the patient.
C. EMS Communications shall notify law enforcement and request their presence at the scene
of the incident. EMS Communications shall also notify the Monterey County EMS Duty
Officer.
D. EMS personnel shall attempt to maintain visual contact with the patient as long as possible
and shall update EMS Communications as needed.
E. EMS shall remain at the scene until cleared by law enforcement or the OnDuty Supervisor.
F. In addition to the ePCR, each crew member of the EMS team transporting the patient at
the time of the patient’s escape shall complete a detailed incident report.
VI. DOCUMENTATION:
When a patient is transported in restraints, the following information must be documented:
A. Reason(s) for use of restraints (danger to self/others, risk/history of violence, etc.).
B. Type of restraints used and what limbs are in restraints.
C. Assessment of patient condition shall be conducted and documented at least every 15
minutes. Documentation shall include the patient’s level of consciousness, respirations,
and distal perfusion to any restrained extremities.
