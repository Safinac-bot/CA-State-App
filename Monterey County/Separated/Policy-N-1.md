## PRINCIPLES OF PRE-PROCEDURAL SEDATION

### Absolute contraindications to Midazolam:

- Sensitivity to Midazolam
- Systolic BP < 90 mmHg

### Important Considerations:

- **Beware of the synergistic effects of combining a benzodiazepine with a narcotic** which may cause significant respiratory depression, decreased LOC, and/or hypotension.

- **Intubation equipment and Naloxone should be readily available** when providing sedation therapy.

- **RASS must be assessed/documented prior to and post pharmacological intervention.**
  - Goal of sedation is a 0 or -1 score on the RASS.
