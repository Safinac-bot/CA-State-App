REDDINET: INTERNET-BASED EMS COMMUNICATION
SYSTEM
I. PURPOSE
A. This policy prescribes the use and management of ReddiNet. ReddiNet is an internetbased application used to track the statuses of resources within the EMS system.
ReddiNet is used in Monterey County to communicate hospital and EMS System status
information, (e.g., hospital service advisories, Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs), etc.)
B. This policy identifies: (1) the roles and responsibilities of ReddiNet users; (2) the statuses
within ReddiNet; (3) ReddiNet access control; (4) use of ReddiNet during critical
incidents; and (5) use of ReddiNet data as EMS performance measures.
II. POLICY/PROCEDURE
A. The Monterey County EMS Communications Center, other EMS Communications
Centers, ambulance-receiving hospitals, and the EMS Agency shall maintain and use
ReddiNet consistent with this policy.
B. Specialty Centers (Trauma, STEMI, and Stroke) will update their status on ReddiNet
when going on "advisory" status. They will update their status when they are no longer
on "advisory."
C. Hospitals will update ReddiNet no less than every twenty-four (24) hours on a routine
basis for daily operations and may be required to update status information more often
during situations such as MCIs or disasters.
D. The Monterey County EMS Communications Center, other EMS Communications
Centers, ambulance-receiving hospitals, and the EMS Agency ReddiNet users shall
determine and manage the access to and use of ReddiNet within their organization.
E. Additional functions and modules (currently not being used) may be implemented in the

operations.
c. Document facility advisories (Hospital Command Center activations) in

monitor ReddiNet and alert ambulance crews to changes in hospital and specialty
service availability and other system issues as appropriate.
5. EMS Agency: The EMS Agency Duty Officer will monitor ReddiNet as
necessary and indicate changes in the status of the EMS Medical Coordination
Center, Health Department Operating Center or Operational Area Emergency
Operations Center on ReddiNet.
IV. STATUS DESCRIPTIONS
A. The following status descriptions are used to identify facility and service status in
ReddiNet:
1. Available (Green): The facility is open to all patients and ambulances (open to
specialty patients in the case of Trauma, STEMI, or Stroke).
2. Unavailable (Red): The facility is in limited operational status due to a lack of
specialty resources; a temporary situation which impacts the reception of specialty
patients (STEMI, Stroke, Trauma).

3. Closed (black): The facility is unavailable due to a "physical plant failure" such as
a power failure, flooding, evacuation, hazardous materials exposure or any other
cause that makes it impossible to receive patients or visitors. Note: when a
hospital declares a physical plant failure, they are closed to all patients, including
walk in patients, and are activating their HICS systems.
4. Unavailable is used only for specialty patients. This status cannot be used for
non-specialty patients. The closed or black status is used when the entire facility
is unable to receive patients or visitors.
5. Individual facilities can view information on the entire EMS system and specific
information on their individual facility. System administrators, such as the EMS
Agency and communications centers, have more access to specific facility
information.
B. Status of Hospital Command Center (HCC) activation. The two statuses for this tab are:
1. Yes (red): there is an active incident.
2. No (green): there are no active incidents (normal operational status).
V. REDDINET ACCESS CONTROL
A. Each organization shall determine which of their staff may access ReddiNet. This
responsibility includes creating and managing individual passwords for each authorized
user, providing training to authorized users, and assuring continuing competency in the
use of ReddiNet.
VI. USE OF REDDINET DURING CRITICAL INCIDENTS
A. During a significant event, such as an MCI or disaster, ReddiNet shall be used to alert
and communicate with hospitals and EMS communication centers. This includes alerts
sent by EMS communications centers to local facilities (i.e., ambulances transporting to
their facility from an MCI), alerts initiated by the facilities themselves (e.g., a physical
plant or safety issue), and polling of hospitals to determine their availability to receive
patients during an MCI or disaster. Limited patient tracking may also be accomplished
via ReddiNet. Use of additional capabilities/modules will be developed over time and
necessary training will take place before implementation (see II F).
VII. USE OF REDDINET DATA AS EMS PERFORMANCE MEASURES
A. The EMS Agency will use information from ReddiNet for quality improvement and
contract compliance purposes. This use includes monitoring the number of hours that
facilities or services have decreased availability and the results of communication tests.
B. This information will be considered EMS system performance metrics and will be
reported to EMS advisory committees.
