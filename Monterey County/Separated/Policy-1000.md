POLICY AND PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
I. PURPOSE
To define the Monterey County Emergency Medical Services Agency's (EMS Agency)
development, public comment, and approval processes for policies, procedures, and patient
treatment protocols.
II. POLICY
The EMS Agency shall follow the procedures outlined in this policy when developing or
revising, and implementing policies, procedures, and patient treatment protocols. The goal of
these procedures is to ensure that all EMS Stakeholders have an opportunity to meaningfully
review and provide comment regarding new or revised policies, procedures, and patient
treatment protocols before they are implemented, unless the change is designated as an
emergency, or minor or administrative change. Additional consensus building, review and
comment measure may be incorporated into the policy development process, as determined
necessary by the EMS Director. For brevity, the term "policy" is used to mean either policy,
procedure, or patient treatment protocol in this policy.
III. REGULAR ANNUAL POLICY REVIEW CYCLE
A. The EMS Agency will incorporate the following phases into the regular annual policy
review cycle:
Phase 1: Preparation and Document Review
1. The EMS Agency will release a list of policies for review during the regular
annual policy review cycle. The EMS Agency will also seek recommendations
from EMS system stakeholders for additional policies for review and update.
Phase 2: Public Comment Period
1. The EMS Agency will widely distribute draft versions of any new or modified
policies for public comment.
2. The public comment period for the regular annual policy review cycle will be a
minimum of 21 days.
3. Comments are due in writing to the EMS Agency by the date on the public
comment notice and the EMS Agency website.

period for potential incorporation into the policy drafts. Following the close of the
public comment period, a summary of the comments received, their disposition,

meeting and posted on the EMS Agency's website.
Phase 3: Development of Training Materials
1. The EMS Agency will develop draft training materials addressing the new and
revised policies.

the EMS provider agencies responsible for training delivery and provide for a
comment period on the materials.
Phase 4: Endorsement
1. New or revised policy drafts will be presented at a CCC meeting. The CCC shall
discuss and vote on a recommendation to the EMS Director and EMS Medical
Director to endorse the final draft versions of the policies. The EMS Director and
Medical Director may accept or reject the committee's recommendation when
determining the final policy content.
2. The EMS Agency will provide the Emergency Medical Care Committee (EMCC)
with summary policy change information at the next regularly scheduled EMCC
meeting.
Phase 5: Mobile Application Update
1. The EMS Agency will prepare the necessary documents and the required testing
to publish the new and updated policies on the mobile app.
Phase 6: Training and Implementation
1. The EMS Agency will release the final training materials. EMS provider
agencies are responsible for training their staff and ensuring sufficient knowledge
of the policy changes.
2. New and updated policies will go into effect on July 1 each year. The EMS
Agency will ensure that the policy changes are reflected on its website and mobile
application.
IV. POLICY RELEASE WITHOUT PUBLIC COMMENT

Director may release policies without public comment under the three following
conditions:
1. Minor Revisions to Policy – The EMS Agency may implement minor revisions
including grammatical, format editing, and/or minor corrections of outdated
