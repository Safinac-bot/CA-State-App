## FENTANYL DILUTION INSTRUCTIONS

**Fentanyl requires dilution for administration to patients weighing less than 25 kg:**

1. Expel and discard 2 ml of Normal Saline (NS) from a 10-ml prefilled syringe, leaving 8 ml of NS in the syringe.

2. Using a 2nd syringe, withdraw 2 ml of Fentanyl 50 mcg/ml (100 mcg) and add it to the 8ml of NS left in the prefilled syringe. This results in a concentration of 10 mcg/ml.

3. Label the syringe.

4. Use a 1 ml or 3 ml syringe to draw up and administer doses. Increments are 1 mcg/0.1 ml.

5. **Do not dilute medication if administering doses via the intranasal (IN) route.**

## WONG-BAKER FACES PAIN RATING SCALE

### Brief initial instructions:
Point to each face using the words to describe the pain intensity. Ask the child to choose the face that best describes their own pain and record the appropriate number.

### Original instructions:
Explain to the person that each face is for a person who feels happy because he has no pain (hurt) or sad because he has some or a lot of pain. Ask the person to choose the face that best describes how he/she is feeling.

- **Face 0** is very happy because he doesn't hurt at all
- **Face 2** hurts just a little bit
- **Face 4** hurts a little more
- **Face 6** hurts even more
- **Face 8** hurts a whole lot
- **Face 10** hurts as much as you can imagine, although you don't have to be crying to feel this bad.
