# NEONATAL RESUSCITATION

---

## ALS and BLS CARE

---

## ALGORITHM

### BIRTH

---

### Decision Point 1: Term gestation? Good tone? Breathing or crying?

**Yes (All three present)** → **Routine Care Pathway**

**No (Any one absent)** → Continue to Decision Point 2

---

## ROUTINE CARE PATHWAY

**Infant stays with mother for routine care:**

- Warm and maintain normal temperature
- Position airway
- Clear secretions if needed
- Dry
- Ongoing evaluation

→ **Transport** with **Early hospital notification**

---

### Decision Point 2: Apnea or gasping? HR < 100/min?

**No** → Continue monitoring → Transport

**Yes (Either condition present)** → **Initial Resuscitation**

---

## INITIAL RESUSCITATION

**Actions:**

- Warm and maintain normal temperature
- Position airway
- Clear secretions/meconium
- Dry
- Stimulate

---

### Decision Point 3: HR < 100/min?

**No** → Continue to Decision Point 4

**Yes** → **Positive Pressure Ventilation**

---

## POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION

**Actions:**

- Position airway
- Clear secretions/meconium
- Ventilate with BVM
- Monitor pulse oximetry
- Consider EKG monitor

---

### Decision Point 4: Persistent central cyanosis?

**No** → Continue monitoring → Transport

**Yes** → Continue ventilatory support

---

### Decision Point 5: HR < 60/min?

**No** → Continue ventilatory support and monitoring

**Yes** → **Ensure adequate ventilation, then begin chest compressions**

---

## CHEST COMPRESSIONS & ADVANCED INTERVENTIONS

**Actions:**

- **Ensure the infant is warm**
- **Check chest movement**
- **Check/change airway position**
- **Check/change BVM technique**
- **Begin chest compressions**
- **Coordinate with BVM ventilations**
- **100% oxygen**
- **EKG monitor**

---

### Decision Point 6: HR < 60/min?

**No** → Continue monitoring → Transport

**Yes** → **Advanced Life Support**

---

## ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT

**Actions:**

- **Initiate IV/IO access**
- **0.01 mg/kg IV/IO of Epinephrine 1:10,000**
- **Consider differential diagnosis**

→ **Transport** with **Early hospital notification**

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Consider the following causes:

### Airway failure
- Respiratory drive
- Secretions

### Other Causes
- Infection
- Maternal medication effect
- Hypovolemia
- Hypothermia
- Hypoglycemia
- Congenital heart disease

| **P**ulse | Absent | <100 beats/min | >100 beats/min | Heart rate |
| **G**rimace | No response to stimulation | Grimace/feeble cry when stimulated | Sneeze/cough/pulls away when stimulated | Reflex irritability |
| **A**ctivity | None | Some flexion | Active movement | Muscle tone |
| **R**espiration | Absent | Weak or irregular | Good/crying | Breathing |
