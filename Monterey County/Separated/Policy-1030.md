system; and
10. Evaluating the impact of the system and revising the system design as needed.
B. Designated Trauma Center(s) Requirements
1. To obtain and maintain designation as a Level II Trauma Center, a hospital must
comply with all standards in the California Code of Regulations Title 22, Division
9, Chapter 7, Article 3. Trauma Center Requirements ยง100259. Level I and Level
II Trauma Centers, the standards contained within the current version of the
American College of Surgeons' Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured
Patient, and meet the requirements specified in Monterey County EMS System
Policy 5060: Trauma Center Standards.
III. Trauma Service Area
A. The Trauma Service Area is the entirety of Monterey County.
IV. Trauma Marketing and Advertising
A. The following shall guide the approval of the term "trauma" and "Trauma Center" in
marketing and advertising for Trauma Centers within Monterey County:
1. Shall provide accurate information;
2. Shall not include false claims;
3. Shall not be critical of other providers; and
4. Shall not include financial inducements to any provider or third parties.
B. Titles may include the word "trauma' in staff position titles.
C. The request to advertise and/or incorporate the term "Trauma Center" in promotional
materials shall be made in writing to the Monterey County EMS Agency. The Monterey
County EMS Agency shall respond in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
written request. No use of the term "trauma", "Trauma Center", or similar terminology
may be used without authorization by the EMS Agency.
V. Trauma Center Coordination with Health Systems
A. The Monterey County EMS Agency field triage policy does not consider the patient's
insurance status in determining the destination of patients who meet trauma triage
criteria. Since patients who require trauma center services may not require this level of
service once they have been stabilized, the Trauma Center should consider the need to
return patients who are insured by HMOs and other managed health care organizations to
their payer's network at a medically-appropriate time.

and other managed health care organizations regarding payment, repatriation of patients,
and other related factors.

organizations in their efforts to identify the appropriate level of care for their members,
including non-emergency treatment and the location of services provided.
D. Nothing in this policy is intended to suggest that the Trauma Center should limit the
treatment provided to members of HMOs and other managed health care organizations in
violation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), other
state or federal law, or good medical practice.
VI. Trauma System Fees
A. Trauma Center Application Fee: A Trauma Center application fee will be established to
cover the costs associated with the designation process. These costs may include contract
costs for plan development, Requests for Proposal (RFP) development, review of
proposals, out-of-area site team costs, and legal reviews and agency costs in excess of the
costs associated with the day-to-day trauma system regulation. The Trauma Center
application fee will be assessed for hospitals applying for Trauma Center designation.
Fees paid that are in excess of actual costs will be returned to applicants.
B. Trauma Center Designation Fee:
1. The Monterey County Board of Supervisors will establish a Trauma Center
designation fee. This fee covers the cost of monitoring the operation of the
trauma care system in compliance with state trauma care systems, regulations, and
regional policies. The fee will be based on the time requirements of the trauma
medical director, trauma coordinator, and other staff activity dedicated to trauma
issues as well as associated overhead and program support costs.
2. The Monterey County EMS Agency will provide the designated Trauma Center
written notice of any increase in the designated fee at least 180 days (6 months)
prior to the effective date of the increase with an explanation for the increase and
the basis on which it was calculated.
3. If the amount is not agreeable to the designated Trauma Center and resolution of
the amount cannot be reached prior to the effective date of the change, or any later
date as mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties, then either party may
terminate the Agreement without penalty. A written notice of 180 days must be
made to the other party to terminate the Agreement. If the Agreement is
terminated, the designation fee in existence at the time notice is given will be prorated until termination.
VII. Mutual Aid Coordination with Neighboring Systems
A. Monterey County EMS will coordinate its trauma care system with those in neighboring
systems to ensure that patients are transported to the most accessible trauma facility
equipped, staffed, and prepared to administer care appropriate to the needs of the patient.
