# BRADYCARDIA-PEDIATRIC

---

## ALS and BLS CARE

**Routine Medical Care.**

> See MP-2 Routine Medical Care-Pediatric or use length-based tape to determine normal heart rate for age.

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

**Identify and treat underlying cause, if known**

- Maintain patent airway; assist breathing as necessary
- O₂ to maintain SpO₂ of >94%
- Cardiac monitor
- IV/IO
- 12 lead ECG

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Persistent bradydysrhythmias causing signs of shock?

**No** → **Monitor and observe**

→ Transport to closest Emergency Department

**Yes** → **Begin Resuscitation**

---

## RESUSCITATION PROTOCOL

**Begin CPR**

**IV NS bolus 20 ml/kg**

**Epinephrine**
- 0.01 mg/kg of 1:10,000 IV/IO
- May repeat q 3-5 minutes

---

### If increased vagal tone or primary AV block:

**Atropine**
- First dose: 0.02 mg/kg
- May repeat q 3-5 minutes
  - Minimum dose: 0.1 mg
  - Maximum total dose: 1.0 mg

---

### Decision Point 2: Continued persistent bradydysrhythmias causing signs of shock?

**No** → Monitor and observe → Transport to closest Emergency Department

**Yes** → **Consider Transcutaneous Pacing (TCP)**

---

## TRANSCUTANEOUS PACING (TCP)

**Base Contact**

**Consider TCP if:**
- Child weighs >15kg
- Child exhibits profound bradycardia refractory to BLS and ALS interventions

**Consider sedation with midazolam with dosing to be determined by base physician order**

---

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

**If asystole develops, go to CP-1: Cardiac Arrest/Asystole Pediatric**

---

## TRANSPORT

**Transport to closest Emergency Department**
