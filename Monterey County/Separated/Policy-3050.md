MPDS RESPONSE PRIORITIES AND RESOURCE ASSIGNMENTS TO
EMS CALLS
I. PURPOSE
To establish clinically-indicated response priorities and response planning for all emergency
medical calls using the Medical Priority Dispatch System™ (MPDS). The MPDS
determinants will drive response plans and priorities to reduce the unnecessary use of lights
and siren and will provide crucial data for EMS system review and Quality Improvement.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Response determinant methodology is defined by the International Academy of
Emergency Dispatch (IAED) in non-linear response levels based on Capability (BLS vs
ALS), single vs multiple resources, and Response Priorities based on the general acuity
of the patient and resources needed.
B. Response Levels (ECHO, DELTA, CHARLIE, BRAVO, ALPHA, and OMEGA) are
designated by the IAED and cannot be modified. However, for the EOA-contracted
ambulance provider, Capability, Response Priority, and Response Resources shall be
assigned by the EMS Medical Director or the EMS Agency.
C. Response Priorities and Resource Assignments are detailed below (see Table 1). The
EMS Medical Director may modify Response Priority and Response Resources to any
level or determinant as needed.
III. POLICY
A. Only designated EMS Communications Center(s) shall dispatch the EOA-contracted
ambulance provider, as specified in this policy.
B. A designated EMS Communications Center shall ensure that all medical calls will be
dispatched using a standard dispatch script.
C. The EOA-contracted ambulance provider response is subject to reassignment to a higher
priority call only if the following conditions exist, as determined by the Emergency
Medical Dispatcher (EMD):
a. The reassignment presents a clear and obvious time savings to the higher priority
call; OR
b. The diversion from the lower priority call will not subject unnecessary risk to the
lower priority patient.

D. Any EOA-contracted ambulance provider response is subject to upgrades or downgrades
of Priority as additional information is obtained or the patient's condition changes, as
determined by MPDS or by first responders on scene. Upgrade of a Priority to lights and
siren is prohibited for the sole purpose of speeding up a perceived extended response by a
transport provider, unless the first responder on scene has determined the patient requires
immediate transport or ALS intervention.
E. EOA-contracted ambulance provider Response Resources and Response Priorities must
be approved by Local Medical Control (EMS Medical Director) and are subject to
internal EMS Agency review at any time. The EMS Medical Director may approve
modifications of Response Resources and/or Response Priorities based on other sources
including, but not limited to: QI processes, medical best practices, case studies, internal
review, and other sources.
Each fire department or fire district may determine their own Response Priorities to each type
of call. If a fire department or fire district chooses to use response plans and/or Response
Priorities that differ from EMS System policies, that fire department or fire district shall
submit its response plans to the EMS Agency.
G. Designated EMS Communications Center(s) shall be responsible to implement internal
Dispatch Review Committee (DRC) and/or Dispatch Steering Committee (DSC)
processes.
IV. RESPONSE ASSIGNMENTS
A. EOA-contracted ambulance provider Response Resources and Response Priorities shall
be built into the CAD in accordance with this policy and EMS Medical Director
approval.
B. Creation of the Medical Call Incident and routing to the dispatch queue for first response
and ambulance dispatch shall occur simultaneously as defined in EMS Agency Policy
3030.
C. Monterey County EMS Agency-approved MPDS Response Resources and Response
Priorities for chief complaint protocols are specified in Table 1.
a. CHARLIE and BRAVO response levels may indicate a single resource or
multiple resources based on recommended resource ETA.
b. BRAVO and ALPHA response levels may have BLS or ALS response
assignment based on recommended resource ETA.
