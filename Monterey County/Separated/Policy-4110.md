ORGAN DONOR
I. PURPOSE
To establish guidelines for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel to meet the
requirements to search for organ donor information on patients for whom death appears
imminent.
II. POLICY
A. Section 7150.55 of the Health and Safety Code, Division 7, Chapter 3.5 requires
emergency medical personnel to make a reasonable search for a document of anatomical
gift, or other information identifying the patient as a donor or an individual who has
refused to make an anatomical gift. Sections 7150.10 and 7150.15 also apply to this
policy.
B. Emergency medical treatment and transport of the patient is the highest priority and a
search for organ donor authorization/refusal shall not interfere with patient care activities.
C. EMS personnel shall attempt, when practical, to locate documentation that indicates
whether an individual desires to be an organ or tissue donor.
III. PROCEDURE
A. All patients require immediate medical evaluation. The search for organ donor
information shall not interfere with patient care activities.
B. When EMS personnel encounter an unconscious adult patient for whom it appears death
is imminent, they shall attempt a reasonable search of the patient's belongings to
determine if the individual carries information indicating the patient's status as an organ
donor. This search must be done in the presence of a witness, preferably a law
enforcement officer.
C. If documentation is found to indicate that the patient desires to be an organ donor, this
documentation shall be brought with the patient to the receiving hospital. If a law
enforcement officer on scene requests to take possession of the documentation, the
documentation shall be provided to the officer and verbal notice made to the receiving
hospital staff. If the patient is not transported to the hospital, the documentation shall
remain with the patient.
