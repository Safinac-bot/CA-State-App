## Performance Objective

Secure placement of a supraglottic airway to facilitate positive pressure ventilation.

### Before performing insertion of a supraglottic, paramedics must:

1. Determine BLS airway adjuncts are inadequate for effective positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and confirm the need for ALS airway placement.

2. Recognize signs of a difficult airway and select, prepare and employ the appropriate supraglottic airway and techniques.
   
   a. A difficult airway is defined as the presence of anatomic conditions which preclude direct visualization of the patient's glottic opening (e.g. airway edema, arthritis, scoliosis of the spine, significant overbite, small mandible, short neck, morbid obesity, cervical spine immobilization, face or neck trauma).

3. Correctly assemble all equipment required for supraglottic airway insertion within 60 seconds.

4. Ensure optimal ventilation and oxygenation of the patient while supraglottic airway equipment is prepared.

### While performing insertion of a supraglottic airway, paramedics must:

1. Minimize oral trauma during insertion by utilizing correct technique.

2. Place the appropriately sized supraglottic airway securely per the manufacturer's instructions in the hypopharynx at the correct depth within 30 seconds.

3. Immediately re-establish PPV with the appropriate rate and tidal volume (minute volume) and oxygen at 10 – 15 LPM following supraglottic airway placement.

4. Confirm correct placement:
   
   a. IMMEDIATELY attach waveform capnography and commence gentle bagging while confirming proper airway placement.
   
   b. Confirm appropriate rectangular waveform is present.
   
   c. Auscultate lung fields and epigastrium.
   
   d. Print strip of capnogram and retain for documentation.
   
   e. Observe for appropriate chest rise and fall.

5. Secure the supraglottic airway at the correct depth per the manufacturer's directions.

6. Stabilize the patient's airway and prevent tube migration by using a device to prevent rotation, flexion, or extension of patient's head.

7. Efficiently employ post supraglottic airway diagnostic tools to thoroughly assess overall effectiveness of ventilatory support throughout the duration of respiratory management efforts, including:
   
   a. Visualization of symmetrical rise and fall of the chest with PPV.
   
   b. Monitor pulse oximetry - the target SpO₂ is greater than 95% if spontaneous circulation is present.
   
   c. Monitor ETCO₂ for appropriate waveform morphology and target CO₂ levels.
      
      1) The target range for ETCO₂ level is between 30 – 45 mmHg if spontaneous circulation is present.
      
      2) In cardiac arrest, metabolic derangements will significantly alter ETCO₂ values and waveform morphology. Target range for ETCO₂ level is between 15 mmHg – 45 mmHg during CPR.
      
      3) Recognize that in a patient with traumatic brain injury, ETCO₂ less than 35 mmHg due to hyperventilation may actually cause harm. Minute volume should be adjusted accordingly while maintaining optimal oxygenation, reserving hyperventilation for those patients showing signs of cerebral herniation only.¹
   
   d. Monitor ECG for dysrhythmias due to vagal stimulation or other treatable causes.
   
   e. Frequent auscultation of lung fields and epigastrium.
   
   f. Constant evaluation of ventilatory compliance and resistance during PPV.

8. Re-implement effective PPV within 10 seconds following unsuccessful supraglottic airway placement attempts.
   
   a. Rapidly transport patients to closest Emergency Department when supraglottic airway placement is unsuccessful and airway patency is not secure.

9. Immediately identify malfunctioning equipment, ineffective techniques or changes in post placement PPV compliance and employ alternative measures to achieve effective ventilations.

10. Reassess supraglottic airway placement each time the patient is moved and before transfer of care to hospital staff.
    
    a. Record and print the waveform ETCO₂ strip prior to transfer of care to the hospital staff and attach the strip to the completed PCR.

11. Provide direction to personnel that have been delegated management of post-supraglottic airway PPV.

12. Maintain effective ventilation and oxygenation throughout the entire prehospital treatment period.

13. Maintain calm, and effectively lead a team-based approach to resuscitation under all conditions.

14. Accurately document all assessment findings, therapeutic treatments and the patient's response to therapy.
