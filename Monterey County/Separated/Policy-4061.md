INTERFACILITY TRANSFER-PHYSICIAN ORDERS
I. PURPOSE
To establish guidelines for patient management when the sending physician provides orders
for patient care during interfacility transfer from an acute care hospital to another acute care
hospital, skilled nursing facility, or patient residence.
II. POLICY
A. Paramedics and EMTs function under the direction of the EMS Medical Director through
established policies, protocols, and procedures, and through on-line medical control
provided by the Base Hospital physician.
B. Paramedics and EMTs may carry out written orders from a California-licensed physician
for patient care during an interfacility transfer, provided the orders do not exceed
Monterey County scope of practice for the paramedic or EMT functioning as the primary
medical provider during the interfacility transfer.
C. Physician orders and/or patient care needs that exceed the scope of practice for Monterey
County paramedics and EMTs shall be provided by a healthcare provider who is trained,
authorized, and credentialed to provide such care during the interfacility transfer.
D. If needed, medical direction from a Base hospital physician shall be obtained as described
below.
III. PROCEDURE
A. Upon arrival at the sending facility and before placing the patient on the ambulance
gurney, EMS personnel shall consult with the medical staff and shall review any
physician orders pertaining to the interfacility transfer. EMS personnel shall confirm the
presence or absence of medication to be administered or procedures to be provided
during the interfacility transfer, including medication or procedures to be provided as
needed.
B. EMS personnel shall not transport a patient who has written orders for care that exceeds
their scope of practice. In such cases, EMS personnel shall promptly notify medical staff
at the sending facility of the issue. The transfer may proceed if the orders are changed to
be within the EMS provider's scope of practice.
C. If the treatment ordered is within the Monterey County scope of practice but requires
Base Hospital physician authorization, the paramedic or EMT shall contact the Base
Hospital physician for authorization prior to initiation of the interfacility transfer.
