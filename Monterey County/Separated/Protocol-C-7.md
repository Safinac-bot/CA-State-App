# CARDIAC ARREST - RETURN OF SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION (ROSC)

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

- Routine Medical Care
- Confirm palpable pulse & auscultate BP
- Monitor EtCO₂ (maintain 35-45 mmHg with PPV)
- O₂ - titrate to SpO₂ 94%
- Perform and transmit 12-Lead ECG
- Check blood glucose
- Cardiac monitor

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: sBP > 90 mmHg?

**No** → Hypotension Management
- **Fluid bolus 500 mL**
- For persistent hypotension (sBP < 90 mmHg), administer **dilute push-dose epinephrine 10 mcg (1 mL) IV/IO***
- May repeat every 2-5 minutes for systolic BP < 90 mmHg

→ Continue to Decision Point 2

**Yes** → Continue to Decision Point 2

---

### Decision Point 2: Pulse < 50 bpm or second or third degree heart block?

**No** → Transport

**Yes** → Bradycardia Management

---

## BRADYCARDIA MANAGEMENT

### Treatment:

- **Atropine 0.5 mg IV/IO q 5 minutes as needed (max 3 mg)** for persistent HR < 50 bpm.
- **Obtain Base Contact** for patients in 2nd degree Type II or 3rd degree heart block.
- **Fluid bolus 500 mL**
- **Transcutaneous Pacing if indicated**

### Indications for pacing:

- Hypotension
- ALOC
- Signs of shock
- Ischemic chest discomfort
- Acute heart failure

---

## TRANSPORT

**Transport to closest, most appropriate STEMI Receiving Center***

> ***Patients with pulses after cardiac arrest where the cause is clearly determined to be other than cardiac (e.g. drowning, electrocution, etc.) are to be transported to the closest ED.**

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

> ***Refer to Policy 4513 for details on preparing and administering dilute push-dose epinephrine.**
