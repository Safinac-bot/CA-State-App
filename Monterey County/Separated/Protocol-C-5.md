# SYMPTOMATIC BRADYCARDIA

---

## BLS CARE

Follow Routine Medical Care Protocol (M-3)

---

## ALS CARE

### Initial Management

**Identify and treat underlying cause, if known**

- Maintain patent airway; assist breathing as necessary
- O₂ - Titrate to SpO₂ of > 94%
- Cardiac monitor
- IV/IO
- 12 Lead ECG

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Persistent bradydysrhythmia causing:

- Hypotension
- ALOC
- Signs of shock
- Ischemic chest discomfort
- Acute heart failure

**No** → Monitor and observe → Transport to closest most appropriate Receiving Center

**Yes** → Continue to Decision Point 2

---

### Decision Point 2: Mobitz II or 3rd degree AV block?

**No** → **Supportive Measures:**
- May repeat **atropine 0.5mg IV** every 5 minutes as needed to a maximum of 3mg.
- Consider **500-1000 ml fluid bolus** if BP does not improve with heart rate correction.

→ Continue to Clinical Improvement Check

**Yes** → Continue to Transcutaneous Pacing

---

### Transcutaneous Pacing Protocol

1. **Atropine 0.5-1 mg IV.**

2. **Sedation for Transcutaneous Pacing** – Refer to Policy N-1 for midazolam

3. **Transcutaneous Pacing.** Initial setting at 60 bpm, 1 mA. Increase in increments of 10 mA until capture. Once capture has been obtained, increase the output by 10%. May increase rate to 70-80 bpm if hypotension still present.

---

### Clinical Improvement Check

**Clinical improvement?**

**Yes** → Monitor and observe → Transport to closest most appropriate Receiving Center

**No** → Additional Interventions

---

### Additional Interventions for Persistent Hypotension

**If BP does not improve with heart rate correction:**

- Consider **NS 500-1,000 mL fluid bolus**
- Administer **dilute push-dose epinephrine 10 mcg (1 mL) IV/IO** in accordance with Policy 4513
- May repeat **push dose epinephrine 10mcg (1 mL) IV/IO every 2-5 minutes** as needed.

→ Transport to closest most appropriate Receiving Center

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

**Consider additional causes of symptomatic bradycardia** such as beta blocker or calcium channel blocker OD. Follow Protocol E-5 Overdose and Poisoning if evidence of OD is present.

> **Note:** Push-dose epinephrine requires dilution. See Policy #4513.
