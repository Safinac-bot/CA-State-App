MEDICATION/SOLUTION SHORTAGES
I. PURPOSE
To establish a process for paramedic service providers to report actual or potential shortages
of medications, intravenous (IV) solutions, and supplies which may cause the provider to not
maintain minimum stock requirements.
To allow paramedic service providers the ability to request a waiver from minimum stock
requirements for medications, IV solutions, and supplies for a period of up to thirty (30)
calendar days. The paramedic service provider may request additional thirty (30) day
waivers should the shortage continue.
II. POLICY
A. Every paramedic unit, whether first response or ambulance, is required to have no less
than the specified amount of medications, IV solutions and supplies specified in
Monterey County EMS System Policy #4010 (Paramedic Provider Authorized Stock) at
all times.
B. Upon recognition of an actual or potential shortage, the paramedic service provider shall
work to mitigate the shortage through all reasonable means, including using alternate
sources to obtain the medications, IV solutions, or supplies.
C. The paramedic service provider shall contact the EMS Duty Officer to provide initial
notice of the actual or potential shortage. The paramedic service provider will also
submit a "Drug Shortage Mitigation and Response Strategies" form (Form #4011B) and a
"Policy 4010 Waiver Request" form (Form #4011A) to the EMS Duty Officer.
D. While evaluating the waiver request, the EMS Agency shall evaluate the potential impact
on other Monterey County paramedic service providers. If the supply shortage affects or
may affect multiple agencies, the EMS Agency may issue a county-wide waiver.
E. Once the paramedic service provider has received the medication and/or IV solution in
short supply, the paramedic service provider shall immediately contact the EMS Agency
and advise them of the arrival of the item(s) under the waiver program. The paramedic
service provider's waiver will then be immediately terminated. If the EMS Agency
issued a county-wide waiver, it will reevaluate the status of this waiver.
F. If the paramedic service provider experiences another shortage/outage, a new waiver
must be requested.
G. Paramedic service providers shall advise the EMS Agency of any changes in
medication/solution inventories (including potential changes) or waiver status.
