HOSPITAL COMMUNICATIONS
PURPOSE:
To establish procedures for phone and radio communications between field personnel and hospital
personnel.
POLICY
A. This policy addresses procedures to be used in two types of hospital communication: base
hospital contact and hospital notification.
B. Base hospital contact is used by paramedic personnel to contact a Monterey County EMS
Agency-designated base hospital for the purpose of obtaining medical direction from a base
hospital physician.
1. Paramedic personnel shall make base hospital contact in the following circumstances:
a. To receive direction for administering medications or providing treatments that
are restricted by policy or protocol to base contact order only.
b. For a patient presenting with symptoms that cause uncertainty regarding the
appropriate protocol to be used.
c. To obtain a field pronouncement of death when the patient does not meet the
criteria listed in Policy #4100 (Pre-Hospital Determination of Death).
d. To perform Advanced Life Support (ALS) treatments or administer medications
not specifically authorized by Monterey County Policy and Protocol but that are
within the Monterey County paramedic scope of practice.
e. For consultation when:
1) The patient has a serious or potentially life-threatening condition but is
refusing care or transport, and base physician involvement may convince
the patient to accept the recommended treatment or transport.
2) There is disagreement among field providers regarding patient care. Refer
to Policy #4000 (Emergency Medical Scene Management).
3) The paramedic believes that base hospital physician involvement will
benefit patient care.
f. When required by Monterey County EMS System Policy.
2. Base contact is not the appropriate communication modality for discussion of the
patient's condition with the base hospital physician, except as detailed above.
3. Base contact should be made to the designated specialty care center when needed as
outlined below:
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3080

a. For patients meeting Step 1-3 Trauma Triage Criteria, contact Natividad. For
any questions related to the destination for adult and pediatric patients
meeting Step 4 trauma triage criteria, or for any patients who do not meet
trauma triage criteria, but whom the paramedic feels may benefit from a
trauma center, base hospital contact should be with Natividad.
b. For patients who are believed to be experiencing a stroke, contact the nearest
Monterey County EMS designated Stroke Center.
c. For patients who are believed to be experiencing an ST-Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (STEMI), contact the nearest Monterey County EMS designated
STEMI Receiving Center.
d. For ROSC in the adult,, contact the nearest STEMI Receiving Center.
4. Base hospital contact shall be with the receiving hospital if that hospital is also a base
hospital. If the receiving hospital is not a base hospital, contact the closest base hospital.
a. If the base hospital is not also the receiving hospital, the base hospital shall
contact the receiving hospital with a report on the patient and any orders given by
the base hospital.
5. In the event of base hospital communication failure, follow Monterey County EMS
System Policy #3091 (Base Hospital Communication Failure).
C. Hospital notification is used to contact the receiving hospital to advise the hospital of
impending patient arrival and condition. Most hospital communications will be hospital
notification only.
1. The purpose of hospital notification is to ensure that the hospital is prepared to receive
the patient with the appropriate bed, equipment, and personnel to care for the patient's
condition.
2. These notifications should also include the proper specialty alert, in order to help the
receiving hospital prepare for the potential needs of the patient.
D. The minimum information to be communicated under base contact or hospital notification is
outlined in the procedure section of this policy.
PROCEDURE
A. Base hospital contact shall be made through a dedicated recorded radio channel or phone line.
B. Communication with a designated base hospital will start with specifying whether the
communication is for base contact or hospital notification.
C. Communications shall utilize the SBAR mnemonic, as below:
1. Situation
2. Background
3. Assessment
4. Recommendations/ Recap

D. A full report should take 60 seconds or less, unless there are multiple patients or other mitigating
circumstances.
E. Paramedics shall repeat any orders given by a base hospital physician prior to closing
communication with the base hospital.
