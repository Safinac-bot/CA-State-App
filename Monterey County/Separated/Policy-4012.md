will comply with this policy; with the intent to prevent and detect the
tampering, theft, loss, and/or diversion of controlled substances.

accountability; master supply storage, security, and documentation;
labeling and tracking, vehicle storage and security, usage procedures and
documentation, reverse distribution, disposal, re-stocking procedures,
transfer or exchange of controlled substances between agencies and/or
services, controlled substance testing, discrepancy reporting; tampering,
theft and diversion prevention and detection; and usage audits.
c. Reporting the suspected tampering, theft, and/or diversion of controlled
substances to local law enforcement is required.
1) If the tampering, theft, and/or diversion of controlled substances is
substantiated, written reports must be made within eight (8) hours

registrant and included on the agency or service's roster of
personnel authorized to audit controlled substances

Monterey County EMS System Policy 4012
Page 9 of 9

a) Establish a baseline for the rate of controlled substance
administration among all individuals authorized to
administer controlled substances during the time-period
being audited
b) Identify high outliers, individuals with high rates of
controlled substance administration
c) Review each administration of controlled substances
performed by these high outliers for accountability and
clinical appropriateness
4) Be performed at least quarterly
b. Records of these audits will be:
1) Maintained at and/or electronically accessible from the agency or
service's quality assurance location
2) Available for inspection within 24 hours by the EMS Agency
3) Maintained for a period of no less than two years
6. Biennial On-Hand Inventory
a. In addition to daily and other routine running inventories, the DEA
requires a separate Biennial On-Hand Inventory. This inventory includes
all controlled substances, including those in a central facility and those
which have been deployed. It also includes those in the reverse
distribution process. It is a "snapshot" count in time. These counts should
be scheduled by every provider in such a way that they are not forgotten.
