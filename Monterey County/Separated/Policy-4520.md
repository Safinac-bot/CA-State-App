OPIOID WITHDRAWAL TREATMENT (BUPRENORPHINE)
I. PURPOSE
To provide guidance for treating patients who are (a) exhibiting signs or symptoms of opioid
withdrawal and/or (b) who have been successfully resuscitated following an opioid overdose,
including the administration of naloxone. ALS providers may activate a prehospital-based
MAT program, which allows paramedics to administer buprenorphine AND link the patient
with a hospital treatment program.
Offering buprenorphine treatment to individuals experiencing opioid withdrawal or to those
who experience a nonfatal opioid overdose provides an opportunity to reduce opioid
overdose fatalities.
This optional scope of practice item is currently limited to AMR paramedics only, although
we anticipate extending this project to all ALS 9-1-1 transport providers in the future. This
limited roll-out will allow us to study cost, utilization, and overall effectiveness before
considering whether to expand the local optional scope of practice (LOSOP) authorization to
all ALS providers.
II. ASSESS FOR EXCLUSION CRITERIA
A. Patients with any of the following exclusion criteria should not receive buprenorphine:
• No opioid withdrawal signs of symptoms
