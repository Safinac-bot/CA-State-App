FIELD TRAUMA TRIAGE CRITERIA
I. PURPOSE
A. The Adult and Pediatric Field Trauma Triage Algorithms are designed to guide the EMS
provider in identifying the Major Trauma Patient and determining the appropriate destination. It
uses a four-step decision process to determine the potential for injury severity and whether it is
likely that the patient would benefit from Trauma Center level of service.
II. POLICY
A. All patients who have sustained trauma will be evaluated using the Field Trauma Triage
Decision Algorithm.
B. Trauma patient destination shall be determined in accordance with the Field Trauma Triage
Decision Algorithm appropriate to the patient's age.
C. Patients determined to have an unmanageable airway shall be transported to the closest
Emergency Department (ED).
D. For patients meeting trauma triage criteria, EMS crews should limit on-scene time to 10 minutes
whenever possible.
E. Pediatric Major Trauma Patients (less than age 15) meeting Step 1 and/or Step 2 criteria are to be
flown to the closest designated Pediatric Trauma Center. If the patient cannot be flown for any
reason (e.g., parental refusal, helicopters unable to fly), transport directly to the closest Trauma
Center (TC).
F. All other trauma patients shall be transported via ground ambulance unless such transport is
unavailable or if ground transport is significantly longer than air transport, and this difference in
time may negatively impact the patient's condition. See EMS Aircraft Operations policy.
G. Base hospital contact with Natividad Medical Center shall be made when considering
transporting an Adult or Pediatric trauma patient who meets Step 1, 2, or 3 criteria to a different
facility than is directed by the Field Trauma Triage Decision Algorithm.
H. Consider sending adult family members to the same trauma center as their children when both
adult and child family members meet trauma criteria. Adult family members who sustain
injuries but do not meet trauma criteria and have a child or children who do meet trauma criteria
may be transported to the same hospital as their children.
I. This policy is not intended to guide mass casualty events. See the Monterey County EMS
Multiple Casualty Incident (MCI) Response Plan.
III. PROCEDURE
Use the following Field Triage Decision Algorithm to help determine the destination for trauma
patients:

Trauma Center consultation is recommended for questions about destinations for injured patients.
Transport Patients with an Unmanageable Airway to the Closest Emergency Department (ED)
Mental Status & Vital Signs
✓ Unable to follow commands (Motor GCS < 6)
✓ RR <10 or >29 breaths/min, or respiratory distress, or need for respiratory support
✓ Age 15-64: Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg or HR > SBP Age > 64: SBP < 110 mmHg or HR > SBP
Step 1
Yes N o
Transport to closest
Trauma Center Assess anatomy of injury
Injury Patterns
✓ Penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso, and extremities proximal to elbow and knee
✓ Chest wall instability, deformity, or suspected flail chest
✓ Suspected fracture of two or more proximal long bone
✓ Crushed, degloved, mangled, or pulseless extremity
✓ Amputation proximal to wrist or ankle
✓ Suspected pelvic fractures
✓ Skull deformity or suspected skull facture.
✓ Suspected spinal injury with new motor and/or sensory loss
✓ Active bleeding requiring a tourniquet or wound packing with continuous pressure
Yes
N o
Transport to closest
Trauma Center
Assess mechanism of injury and evidence
of high-energy impact
Mechanism of Injury (MOI)
✓ Falls from height > 10 ft
✓ High-risk auto crash
- Ejection (partial or complete) from automobile
- Intrusion (including roof) > 12 inches into occupant site or > 18 inches into any part of passenger compartment
- Need for extrication for entrapped/pinned patient with injuries
- MVC at > 45 MPH with significant pain or injury.
✓ Death in same passenger compartment
✓ Vehicle telemetry data consistent with high risk of injury
✓ Rider separated from transport vehicle with significant impact (e.g., motorcycle, ATV, horse, etc.)
✓ Auto vs. pedestrian/ bicyclist thrown, run over, or with significant impact
Yes N o
Transport to closest
Trauma Center Assess for special patient or system considerations
EMS Judgement
Consider risk factors including:
✓ Low-level falls in older adults (age > 65 years) with significant head impact
✓ Special, high-resource healthcare needs
✓ Anticoagulants and bleeding disorders
✓ Burns
- Without other trauma mechanism: triage to Burn Facility
- With trauma mechanism: triage to Trauma Center
✓ Pregnancy > 20 weeks
✓ If concerned, transport to a Trauma Center
Step 2
Step 3
Step 4
Consider transporting to trauma center.
