# HYPOTHERMIA-PEDIATRIC

---

## ALS AND BLS CARE

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

**Routine Medical Care (MP-2).**

- Remove patient from cold environment.
- **Avoid rough handling.**
- Remove wet clothing and dry the patient.
- Cover with dry blankets (warm if available).

---

## ALGORITHM

### Assess responsiveness

---

### PATHWAY 1: AWAKE WITHOUT ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (AMS)

- Airway management and oxygen as appropriate
- Check blood sugar - treat hypoglycemia (NP-2)
- For patients with altered mental status, consider possible causes
- Apply EKG and consider 12 lead EKG

**Active warming measures:**
- Apply warm blankets if available
- Apply hot packs to armpits, groin, and neck
- **Take precautions to prevent burns**

**Establish IV/IO access with warm fluids**
- Administer 20 ml/kg fluid bolus
- May repeat fluid bolus once to age appropriate SBP

**Early transport**

---

### PATHWAY 2: UNRESPONSIVE OR COMATOSE

### Decision Point: Pulse Present?

**Yes** → Continue with supportive care and early transport

- Airway management and oxygen as appropriate
- Check blood sugar - treat hypoglycemia (NP-2)
- For patients with altered mental status, consider possible causes
- Apply EKG and consider 12 lead EKG

**Active warming measures:**
- Apply warm blankets if available
- Apply hot packs to armpits, groin, and neck
- **Take precautions to prevent burns**

**Establish IV/IO access with warm fluids**
- Administer 20 ml/kg fluid bolus
- May repeat fluid bolus once to age appropriate SBP

**Early transport**

---

**No** → **CARDIAC ARREST PATHWAY**

---

### PATHWAY 3: NO PULSE (CARDIAC ARREST)

**Start CPR**

**Utilize appropriate pediatric cardiac arrest protocol**

**Attach AED/monitor/defibrillator**

**For profound hypothermia:**
- **Limit defibrillations to one shock only for profound hypothermia**

**Initiate active warming measures**

**Establish IV/IO access with warm fluids**

**Administer only one single dose of epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg of 1:10,000 concentration**

**Early transport**

---

## IMPORTANT NOTE

> **Profound hypothermia is defined as a core temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit or less.**
