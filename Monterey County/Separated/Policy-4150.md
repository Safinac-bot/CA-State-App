Responder Agency's application primarily for: (1) clinical benefit, clinical detriment, and
clinical effect on patients within the Monterey County EMS System; (2) financial and
operational benefit, financial and operational detriment, and financial and operational
effect on and the Monterey County EMS System.

Agency for failure to comply with applicable policies, procedures, and regulations.
