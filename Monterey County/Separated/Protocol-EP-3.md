---

## ALS AND BLS CARE

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

**Routine Medical Care (Protocol MP-2)**

- Move to a cool environment
- Remove excess clothing
- Cooling measures
- Assess blood glucose levels
- Consider non-environmental causes

---

## ASSESS SYMPTOM SEVERITY

---

### HEAT CRAMPS

**PO water or electrolyte solution as tolerated**

**Reassess and Monitor**

→ Transport to closest ED

---

### HEAT EXHAUSTION

**Administer IV/IO fluids: 20 mL/kg up to 1 L NS**

**Monitor and reassess**

**Repeat IV/IO fluids as needed**

**For BGL <70 mg/dL, administer Dextrose in accordance with Protocol NP-2.**

→ Transport to closest ED

---

### HEAT STROKE

---

### Decision Point: Adequate airway and breathing?

**Yes** → Continue to active cooling

**No** → **Assist ventilations and manage airway as needed**

---

## ACTIVE COOLING MEASURES

**Active cooling measures. Do not stimulate shivering.**

**Administer IV/IO fluids: 20 mL/kg up to 1 L NS**

**Monitor and reassess**

**Repeat IV/IO fluids as needed**

**For BGL <70 mg/dL, administer Dextrose in accordance with Protocol NP-2.**

**Treat seizures and cardiac arrhythmias per protocol**

→ Transport to closest ED

## PRINCIPLES OF HYPERTHERMIA

### Rapid cooling is indicated for patients with symptoms indicative of heat stroke

**Active cooling:**
- Wet the patient's skin and promote convection and evaporation with fanning or the ambulance A/C.
- Apply cold packs to the neck, axilla, and groin.

### Potential environmental causes:

- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)
- Sympathomimetic overdose
- Anticholinergic toxidrome
