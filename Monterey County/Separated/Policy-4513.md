EPINEPHRINE FOR HYPOTENSION
("PUSH-DOSE" EPINEPHRINE)
I. PURPOSE
A. To define the indications and procedure for the use of epinephrine to manage persistent
hypotension refractory to other treatments.
II. POLICY
A. Epinephrine for persistent hypotension is a standing order for those conditions as
authorized in Monterey County EMS protocols.
B. Epinephrine for persistent hypotension requires a base hospital physician order for
patients with persistent hypotension from conditions not found in Monterey County EMS
field treatment protocols.
C. For the purpose of push-dose administration for treatment of persistent hypotension,
prefilled ampules of 1:10,000 epinephrine must be diluted with Normal Saline in
accordance with the procedure detailed below. Administering undiluted 1:10,000 or
1:1,000 epinephrine IV or IO can cause stroke, heart attack, or cardiac arrest.
D. NEVER prepare push-dose epinephrine by attempting to dilute an ampule of 1:1,000-
concentration epinephrine.
E. The 10 mL syringe with the epinephrine and saline mixed shall be immediately labeled
with the pre-made label established by the EMS Agency.
III. PROCEDURE
A. Treat the patient using the appropriate protocol for the patient's condition.
B. Establish patent IV or IO access.
C. Open a preloaded ampule of 1:10,000 epinephrine (1 mg of epinephrine in a preloaded
10-mL ampule). Remove the yellow plastic cap from the ampule. Do not attach the
ampule to the Luer-Jet syringe that comes in the pre-packaged box.
D. Using an empty 10-mL syringe with an attached 18-gauge needle, insert the needle
through the blue stopper of the 1:10,000 epinephrine ampule and draw up 1 mL of
1:10,000 epinephrine from the preloaded ampule.
E. Using the same 10-mL syringe (which now contains 1 mL of 1:10,000 epinephrine), draw
up 9 mL of Normal Saline from a bag of Normal Saline. (Do not inject the epinephrine
into the bag of Normal Saline.)

F. Mix the epinephrine and Normal Saline by vigorously shaking the syringe. Attach an
orange-colored label to the syringe identifying the contents as "Epinephrine (10
mcg/mL)".
G. Attach the bag of Normal Saline to the IV or IO line and infuse Normal Saline at a rate
appropriate for the patient's condition.
H. Using the labeled syringe containing dilute epinephrine (10 mcg/mL concentration),
administer 0.5 - 1 mL (5-10 mcg) IV/IO every 2-5 minutes as needed to maintain a
systolic BP greater than or equal to 90 mmHg.
I. Document the time and dosage of each administration of epinephrine.
J. Re-check and document the patient's blood pressure every 2-3 minutes.
