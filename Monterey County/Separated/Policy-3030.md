EMS CALL ROUTING AND PROCESSING
I. PURPOSE
To define the requirements and procedures for Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) and
Public Safety Agencies to identify and route all appropriate Medical Calls to a designated EMS
Communications Center in Monterey County, so that certified Emergency Medical Dispatchers
can provide Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) services. These procedures include both
concurrence or non-concurrence of Public Safety Agencies with jurisdiction to continue
delegation of EMS call processing or to maintain EMS call processing within a Public Safety
jurisdiction.
II. POLICY
A. Concurrence: All appropriate Medical Calls in Monterey County, once identified, shall be
immediately routed to a designated Monterey County EMS Communications Center for
proper MPDS assessment, Post-Dispatch Instructions, and Pre-Arrival Instructions. This
includes all first, second, and appropriate third-party callers.
B. Non-Concurrence: All appropriate Medical Calls in Monterey County, once identified,
shall immediately receive proper MPDS assessment, Post-Dispatch Instructions, and PreArrival Instructions by Public Safety communications personnel in compliance with EMS
System Policies.
III. PROCEDURE
A. Concurrence Public Safety/PSAP Medical Call Routing:
1. All Medical Call phone transfers shall ensure ANI/ALI information, if available,
is sent with the caller to the designated EMS Communications Center.
2. The designated EMS Communications Center shall work with local PSAPs to
develop and implement policies that address special call handling procedures,
including but not limited to: multiple callers for a single incident, language barrier
calls, and rescue events.
3. All Monterey County PSAPs shall ensure that call intake procedures only obtain
essential information on Medical Calls prior to transfer of the caller to the
designated EMS Communications Center and shall not conduct any medical
screening or other redundant questioning contained within a MPDS interrogation.
a. An exception to the routing of the caller in this policy is when a PSAP
determines it is not safe to transfer the caller to the designated EMS
Communications Center. In those cases, such as Law Enforcement calls,
scene safety concerns, and some specialized rescue, the PSAP shall ensure
the address, chief compliant, and safety instructions are immediately

included in the comments of the call notes and shall not delay EMS call
creation or response to the address of the emergency. For the Exclusive
Operating Area (EOA) contracted ambulance provider, all such calls that
cannot be immediately processed through MPDS shall be assigned a
Priority 2 response unless otherwise requested by first responders on
scene, law enforcement, or subsequent MPDS determinant.
4. Once a PSAP has completed their interrogation, if appropriate, they should
transfer the caller to a designated EMS Communications Center for MPDS
processing.
5. All initial, subsequent, or modified Public Safety/PSAP policies and procedures
related to this EMS System policy shall be made available to the EMS Agency
before implementation.
B. Non-Concurrence Public Safety/PSAP Medical Call Routing:
1. Public Safety/PSAPs shall develop and implement policies that ensure all Medical
Calls are properly identified and processed through MPDS procedures consistent
with EMS System polices.
2. Public Safety/PSAPs shall ensure all appropriate responders (Police, Fire, EMS)
receive the call simultaneously for proper assignment by their respective
dispatchers.
3. All initial, subsequent, or modified Public Safety/PSAP policies and procedures
related to this EMS System policy shall be made available to the EMS Agency
before implementation.
C. Concurrence and Non-Concurrence Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS
Communications Center Medical Call entry and MPDS:
1. The Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center shall
ensure that all Medical Calls include a problem nature protocol description
selected in CAD that corresponds exactly with the MPDS protocol numbers 1-33
descriptions.
2. The Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center shall
ensure that MPDS is used on all Medical Calls, including requests from medical
facilities to transport a patient to the emergency department (ED) (Card 33).
3. The Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center shall
ensure all available comments; including scene safety, and patient condition, are
documented in the call by the call taker or Emergency Medical Dispatcher and are
available, real time, for responders to view.
4. The Emergency Medical Dispatcher shall remain on the phone on all ECHO level,
and appropriate DELTA level calls, to provide post-dispatch instructions, prearrival instructions, or to maintain and monitor, until first responders are with the
patient.
D. Concurrence Public Safety/PSAP and/or designated EMS Communications Center
Medical Call Dispatch Process:
Monterey County EMS System Policy 3030
Page 3 of 3
1. Once Public Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center
identifies a call as a Medical Call, and an accurate location is identified, Public
Safety/PSAPs and/or designated EMS Communications Center shall ensure the
call is created/generated in the CAD assignment queue simultaneously for Fire
first response and ambulance response.
2. All Medical Calls shall initially be created as a Priority 2 response for the EOA
contracted ambulance provider.
3. Once the Emergency Medical Dispatcher has assigned a MPDS determinant, the
EOA contracted ambulance provider response priority shall be modified by the
appropriate dispatcher, if necessary, based on the criteria in EMS System Policy
and Procedure 3050: MPDS Response Priorities and Assignments to EMS Calls.
4. Once an Emergency Medical Dispatcher has assigned a MPDS determinant, the
Emergency Medical Dispatcher shall immediately provide the updated
determinant to the first responder.
5. Any reduction or increase of an ambulance response priority to a Medical Call,
for any reason, shall be recorded so that upon request it is available to the EMS
Agency for accurate data analysis and response time calculations.
