Monterey County EMS System Policy
Policy Number: 4503
Effective Date: 7/1/2025
Review Date: 6/30/2028
CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP)
I. PURPOSE
To establish guidance on the appropriate use of CPAP when treating patients experiencing
moderate to severe respiratory distress. Patients experiencing respiratory distress from
pulmonary edema, COPD, asthma, near drowning, pneumonia, or any other conditions where
respiratory gas exchange is inadequate and may lead to respiratory failure.
II. POLICY
A. All Paramedic Service Provider and EMT-Expanded Scope personnel shall have
documented training in the use of the CPAP machine currently in use by the EMS
Service Provider. The training shall include both instructions on the practical
applications of the device and documentation that the provider understands this policy. In
addition, yearly refresher training shall be given to all applicable providers.
B. CPAP should be used in accordance with the conditions outlined below.
III. INDICATIONS
Patient's age 9 or older in severe respiratory distress.
IV. CONTRAINDICATIONS
ABSOLUTE Contraindications (DO NOT USE)
A. Age < 9 years
B. Respiratory or Cardiac Arrest
C. Agonal Respirations
D. Severely depressed level of consciousness
E. Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg
F. Signs and symptoms of pneumothorax
G. Major facial, head, neck, or chest trauma
H. Inability to maintain airway patency
I. Facial anomalies that prevent adequate mask seal
J. Possible transmissible airborne infectious disease (COVID, TB, etc.)
K. Vomiting or active GI bleeding
L. Stomach surgery (including gastric sleeve) within the past month
RELATIVE Contraindications (USE WITH CAUTION)
A. History of pulmonary fibrosis
B. History of pneumothorax
C. Claustrophobia or unable to tolerate mask (after coaching attempt and a two-minute trial)
V. PROCEDURE
A. Prior to applying the CPAP device, explain the treatment and inform the patient of what
to anticipate. The patient should be either sitting (preferred) or standing upright when
utilizing the CPAP. Approach the patient slowly with the mask and hold it a few
centimeters away from their face prior to application and securing the head straps.
B. Follow the manufacturer's directions for set up and placement of the CPAP device.
Make sure that oxygen is flowing prior to placing the mask over the patient's face and
securing the head straps. If air is leaking from the face seal, assess the cause and readjust
either the mask positioning or tension on the head straps. Consider changing the mask
size if necessary.
C. Start CPAP at 7.5 cm H2O. The provider may increase the pressure up to 10 cm H2O
based on the patient's presentation. Base hospital contact shall be obtained to adjust the
pressure > 10 cm H2O.
D. In-line nebulization may be used with the CPAP circuit to administer a bronchodilator
during CPAP use.
E. Monitor and document vital signs (BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, SPO2, cardiac rhythm,
and ETCO2) and patient response to treatment every 5 minutes.
F. Observe for signs of deterioration or failure of patient response to CPAP.
