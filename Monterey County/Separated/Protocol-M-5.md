## ALS and BLS CARE

### Initial Assessment

**Patient is agitated and a danger to self or others**

- Attempt to determine the presence of cognitive impairments or developmental disabilities
- Attempt to reasonably address patient concerns
- Assemble personnel (including law enforcement if needed)

**Assume the patient has a medical cause of agitation and treat reversible causes**

- Routine Medical Care (Protocol M-3)

---

### Utilize verbal de-escalation techniques

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point: Does the patient's behavior or level of agitation pose a clear danger to self or others?

**No** → Continue monitoring and transport

**Yes** → Sedation Protocol

---

## SEDATION PROTOCOL

### Initial Sedation

**If the patient does not respond to de-escalation attempts, see:**
- Use of Restraint Policy (#4508)

**Midazolam**
- **5 mg IM/IN**

**OR**

- **If an IV/IO is already in place, administer Midazolam 2-4 mg IV/IO**

> **Do not attempt to place an IV in a severely agitated patient**

---

### Post-Sedation Care

**As soon as may be safely accomplished:**

- Check blood glucose
- Oxygen administration to maintain SpO₂
- EKG monitoring / 12 Lead EKG
- EtCO₂ monitoring
- Establish IV/IO access
- Consider administering IV/IO fluids
  - 20 mL/kg bolus Normal Saline up to 1L – May repeat as necessary
- Treat Hyperthermia (Protocol E-3)
- Be prepared to provide airway/ventilation support

---

### Decision Point: Still significantly agitated?

**No** → Continue monitoring and transport

**Yes** → Repeat Sedation

---

### Repeat Sedation

**Sedate/Repeat Sedation**

**Midazolam 2-4 mg IV/IO**

**OR**

**5mg IM/IN**

> **Base Hospital Contact required for additional doses**

**Use of Restraint Policy (#4508)**

---

## IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES

- **RASS must be assessed/documented prior to and post pharmacological intervention.**
- **The goal of sedation is a 0 or -1 on the RASS.**
- **Prevent positional asphyxiation by avoiding prone positioning, hog-tie applications, or other positions that limit diaphragmatic excursion**
