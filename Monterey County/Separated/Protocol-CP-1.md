# CARDIAC ARREST-ASYSTOLE/PEA-PEDIATRIC

---

## BLS CARE

Follow Routine Medical Care Protocol (MP-2)

Consider and treat potential causes of the patient's condition.

---

## INITIAL RESPONSE

**Begin CPR.**

Consider and treat potential causes of the patient's condition.

**Apply AED immediately when available**
- AED pads must not touch after placement on the patient.
- Anterior-Posterior placement for pads preferred.

---

## CPR PROTOCOL

### CPR - 2 minutes

**2 Rescuers:** 15:2 for 10 cycles

**1 Rescuer:** 30:2 for 5 cycles

**Rotate personnel providing chest compressions every 2 minutes.**

**Apply AED/defibrillator as soon as it is available.**
- Anterior-posterior pad placement preferred.

---

### Check Rhythm

**No pulse - Continue CPR**

**Continue CPR for two minutes.**

**AED rhythm check and assess for spontaneous circulation.**

**Continue resuscitation efforts if no return of spontaneous circulation.**

---

## ALS CARE

### ALS Interventions:

- CPR
- Oxygen - High Flow - BVM
- Cardiac Monitor
- **Monitor EtCO₂ (Mandatory)**
- IV/IO
- **NS 20 ml/kg bolus** (May repeat 1 time)
- **Epinephrine 1:10,000 0.01 mg/kg** (May repeat every 3-5 minutes)

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Shockable Rhythm?

**Yes (V. Fib/Pulseless V. Tach)** → **Go to CP-2**

**No** → Continue CPR and treatment

---

### Decision Point 2: Organized rhythm and pulse present?

**Yes** → **Go to CP-7 ROSC**

**No** → Continue to Decision Point 3

---

### Decision Point 3: Persistent asystole or PEA?

**No** → Continue resuscitation efforts

**Yes** → **Consider Termination of CPR**

---

## ONGOING MANAGEMENT

**If continuing resuscitation:**

- Continue CPR (20 minutes minimum)
- Continue epinephrine 1:10,000 0.01 mg/kg
- Transport to closest ED

**Consider possible causes and provide appropriate treatment for identified cause**

---

## REVERSIBLE CAUSES

- **H - Hypovolemia**
- **H - Hypoxia**
- **H - Hydrogen ions (Acidosis)**
- **H - Hypo/Hyperkalemia**
- **H - Hypothermia**
- **T - Tablets/Toxins**
- **T - Tamponade**
- **T - Tension pneumothorax**
- **T - Thrombosis (MI/CVA)**
- **T - Thromboembolism**

---

## TERMINATION OF CPR

### May be considered for:

**All of the following criteria must be met:**

- Persistent asystole or bradycardic PEA (rate less than 40/min)

**AND**

- EtCO₂ <10 mmHg

**AND**

- No other intermittent cardiac rhythms

**AND**

- CPR provided for at least 20 minutes with three (3) doses of epinephrine

---

### Base Physician Contact
