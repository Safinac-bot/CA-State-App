## Performance Objective

Administration of the appropriate dose of epinephrine IV/IO for hypotension.

---

## Before administering epinephrine for hypotension, paramedics must:

1. Verify the presence of hypotension.

2. Attempt other methods of treating hypotension appropriate to the patient's condition.

3. Establish patent IV/IO access.

---

## While administering epinephrine for hypotension, paramedics must:

1. Ensure patent IV or IO access.

2. Open a preloaded ampule of 1:10,000 epinephrine (1 mg of epinephrine in a preloaded 10-mL ampule). Remove the yellow plastic cap from the ampule. Do not attach the ampule to the Luer-Jet syringe that comes in the pre-packaged box.

3. Using an empty 10-mL syringe with an attached 18-gauge needle, insert the needle through the blue stopper of the 1:10,000 epinephrine ampule and draw up 1 mL of 1:10,000 epinephrine from the preloaded ampule.

4. Using the same 10-mL syringe (which now contains 1 mL of 1:10,000 epinephrine), draw up 9 ml of Normal Saline from a bag of Normal Saline. (Do not inject the epinephrine into the bag of Normal Saline.)

5. Mix the epinephrine and Normal Saline by vigorously shaking the syringe.

6. Attach a label to the syringe, identifying the contents as: "Epinephrine (10 mcg/mL)".

7. Using the labeled syringe containing dilute epinephrine (10 mcg/mL concentration), administer 0.5-1 mL (5-10 mcg) IV/IO every 2-5 minutes as needed to maintain a systolic BP â‰¥ 90 mmHg.

8. Document the time and dosage of each administration of epinephrine.

9. Re-check and document the patient's BP every 2-3 minutes.

---

## Critical Success Targets for administration of epinephrine for hypotension:

1. Prepare the correct concentration of epinephrine (10 mcg/mL).
2. Timely administration of epinephrine at the appropriate place in the sequence of patient care activities.

---

## System Benchmark

Administration of the appropriate concentration of epinephrine at the appropriate place in the sequence of treatments for patients with persistent hypotension.

---

## Core Competency Requirements to be covered during education/training on Epinephrine for Hypotension:

1. Identify patient conditions for which epinephrine for hypotension is appropriate.

2. Demonstrate an understanding of protocols that include epinephrine for persistent hypotension.

3. List conditions for which a Base Hospital physician order is required to administer epinephrine for persistent hypotension.

4. Identify the appropriate concentration of epinephrine to use in the preparation of dilute push-dose epinephrine.

5. Demonstrate the ability to assess a patient for persistent hypotension.

6. Accurately verbalize and demonstrate the correct technique for preparing and administering dilute epinephrine (10 mcg/mL).

7. Identify patient assessments (blood pressure, mental status, skin changes, symptom improvement, etc.) that can be performed to determine whether dilute push-dose epinephrine administration has been effective or requires additional dosing.

8. Correctly identify frequency of post-administration BP monitoring.

9. Recognize complications (overdose, extravasation, hypertension, dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest).

10. Team leadership and patient safety

11. Documentation

## Epinephrine for Hypotension (Push-dose epi) - Performance Steps

| Successful (y/n) | Performance Steps | Additional Information |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| | Take or verbalize appropriate body substance isolation precautions | Selection: gloves, goggles, mask, gown, booties, P100 PRN |
| | Determine other measures to maintain a systolic BP of > 90 mmHg are not adequate (IV or IO established) | A patent IV/IO is in place.<br>Fluid bolus of NS 500 mL attempted as appropriate for patient's condition.<br>Heart rate correction attempted as appropriate. |
| | Initiates base physician contact for order to administer epinephrine for persistent hypotension when the patient's condition is not included in a protocol allowing the use of epinephrine for hypotension. | Hypotension with a likely cause of sepsis requires base physician order. |
| | Correctly assemble all supplies needed to mix and administer epinephrine. | Epinephrine 1:10,000 pre-load ampule, 10 mL syringe with 18 gauge needle |
| | Epinephrine 1 mL of 1:10,000 solution drawn up into a 10 mL syringe | Epinephrine 1 mL of 1:10,000 solution is created. |
| | 9 mL Normal Saline drawn up into the syringe and mixed. | Epinephrine is not injected into the IV bag of normal saline. |
| | Syringe with epinephrine 10 mcg/mL labeled correctly. | |
| | Epinephrine 0.5-1 mL of 10 mcg/mL administered | |
| | Blood pressure measurement obtained | |
| | Additional doses of epinephrine 0.5-1 mL of 10 mcg/mL administered every 2-5 minutes as indicated for continued hypotension | Epinephrine not administered until blood pressure measurement is obtained |
| | Patient's blood pressure is monitored between each dose of epinephrine 0.5-1 mL of 10 mcg/mL | Patient's systolic BP is less than 90 mmHg prior to administering epinephrine |
| | Each dose of epinephrine is recorded on the PCR | |
| | The patient's BP is recorded on the PCR for the BP prior to administration of epinephrine, between each dose, and prior to transfer of patient care to the ED. | |

## Critical Failure Criteria

- Failure to take or verbalize BSI appropriate to the skill prior to performing the skill
- Failure to correctly mix the epinephrine to a 10 mcg/mL concentration
- Failure to prevent injection of epinephrine into the IV NS bag
- Failure to provide care in mixing the epinephrine that puts others at risk of needlestick injury
- Failure to label syringe properly immediately after creating dilute epinephrine (10 mcg/mL)
- Failure to document all doses of epinephrine
- Failure to monitor the patient's BP as required
- Failure to make Base Hospital contact when administering epinephrine for conditions not approved by protocol
- Any procedure that would have harmed the patient
