# CHILDBIRTH

---

## ALS and BLS CARE

### Initial Management

- Routine Medical Care (Protocol M-3)
- Obtain obstetrical history

### Obstetrical History Items:

- Due date
- Gravida/Para status
- Contraction start time/how often
- Rupture of membranes
- High risk pregnancy
- Length of previous labors
- Narcotic use in past 4 hours

---

### Initial Assessment

**If in active labor:**

- Allow patient to remain in position of comfort.
- Visualize the perineum.
- Determine if there is time to transport.

**Position of comfort - Left lateral preferred**

- Document frequency and duration of contractions
- Monitor for progression to imminent delivery

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Priority Symptoms?

**Presence of prolapsed umbilical cord, breech presentation**

**Yes** → **Go to Obstetrical Complications (Protocol O-2)**

→ Expedite transport → Transport to closest ED

**No** → Continue to Decision Point 2

---

### Decision Point 2: Imminent delivery?

**Delivery is imminent if there is crowning or bulging of the perineum**

**No** → Transport to requested hospital

**Yes** → Emergency Childbirth Procedure

---

## EMERGENCY CHILDBIRTH PROCEDURE

### Delivery Steps:

1. Place mother in position of comfort - preferably supine on flat surface

2. **Do not attempt to delay delivery**

3. Support and control delivery of infant's head as it emerges

4. Protect perineum with gentle hand pressure

5. Check for cord around neck. If present, gently slip it over the head. **If unable to free the cord, double clamp cord and cut between the clamps.**

6. Suction mouth then nose of infant **only if signs of obstruction are noted.**

7. **If delivery is not progressing, baby is stuck** see Obstetrical Complications (Protocol O-2) and **begin immediate transport**

8. As shoulders emerge, gently guide head and neck downward to deliver anterior shoulder. Support and gently lift head and neck to deliver posterior shoulder

9. The infant's body should deliver with passive participation - maintain a firm hold on the infant

10. **Record time of delivery**

11. Keep newborn at level of mother's vagina until cord stops pulsating and is double clamped

12. See Protocol O-3 Neonatal Resuscitation for infant in distress

---

## POSTPARTUM CARE: INFANT

✓ Suction mouth and nose **only if signs of obstruction are noted**

✓ Respirations should begin within 15 seconds after stimulating the neonate. If not, begin artificial ventilations at 40-60 breaths/min

✓ If apneic, unresponsive, persistent central cyanosis, or HR < 100, begin neonatal resuscitation

✓ Dry baby and wrap in warm blanket

✓ After umbilical cord stops pulsating, apply clamps 6" and 8" from infant's abdominal wall and cut between clamps

✓ Document 1 and 5 minute APGAR scores

✓ Monitor and reassess

## APGAR SCORE CRITERIA

| Component of Acronym | Score of 0 | Score of 1 | Score of 2 | Measures |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **A**ppearance | All blue, pale | Cyanosis to extremities | No cyanosis | Skin Color |
| **P**ulse | Absent | <100 beats/min | >100 beats/min | Heart rate |
| **G**rimace | No response to stimulation | Grimace/feeble cry when stimulated | Sneeze/cough/pulls away when stimulated | Reflex irritability |
| **A**ctivity | None/limp | Some flexion | Active movement | Muscle tone |
| **R**espiration | Absent | Weak or irregular | Good/crying | Breathing |

---

## POSTPARTUM CARE: MOTHER

✓ Placenta should deliver in 20-30 minutes. If delivered, collect in plastic bag and bring to the hospital. **Do not pull cord to facilitate placenta delivery and do not delay transport awaiting placenta delivery**

✓ If the perineum is torn and bleeding, apply direct pressure with sanitary pads

✓ **For postpartum hemorrhage - see Obstetrical Complications (Protocol O-2)**

✓ Initiate transport once delivery of the child is complete and mother can tolerate movement

---

## TRANSPORT

**Transport to patient's requested hospital**
