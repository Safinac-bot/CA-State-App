# BURNS-PEDIATRIC

---

## ALS and BLS

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

### Stop the burning process:

- Remove clothes if not adhered to patient's skin.
- Flood with water only if flames/smoldering present.

**Routine Medical Care (Protocol M-3)**

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Respiratory distress, hoarseness, or stridor?

**Yes** → **Airway Management**

- Oxygen NRB 15 Lpm.
- Albuterol 2.5 mg via nebulizer for signs or symptoms of bronchospasm. May repeat once.
- Manage airway and assist ventilations as needed.
- Consider CO exposure.

**No** → Continue to burn assessment

---

## BURN ASSESSMENT

**Evaluate degree and body surface area (BSA) involved**

---

### Decision Point 2: Critical Burns?*

**Yes** → **Critical Burn Management**

**No** → **Non-Critical Burn Management**

---

## CRITICAL BURN MANAGEMENT

- **Consider transporting directly to a Burn Center**

**For patients with > 20% BSA 2nd & 3rd degree burns:**
- Start a large-bore IV or IO
- Initiate fluid resuscitation with Lactated Ringers (LR)

---

### Fluid Resuscitation Rates:

- **1-5 yrs old:** 125 mL LR per hour
- **6-13 yrs old:** 250 mL LR per hour

---

**Additional Management:**

- Remove constricting items.
- Dress burns with dry sterile dressings.
- Treat other injuries per protocols.
- Cover patient to keep warm.

**Consider Pain Control (Protocol MP-2)**

---

## NON-CRITICAL BURN MANAGEMENT

- **IV NS TKO**
- Remove constricting items.
- Dress burns with dry sterile dressings.
- Treat other injuries per protocols.
- Cover patient to keep warm.

**Consider Pain Control (Protocol MP-2)**

→ **Transport to closest Emergency Department**

---

## TYPES OF BURNS

- **Thermal** – remove from environment, put out fire.
- **Chemical** – brush off or dilute chemical, consider HAZMAT team.
- **Electrical** – make sure patient is de-energized and suspect internal injuries.
- **Assume CO if enclosed space.**

---

## *CRITICAL BURNS CRITERIA

**Do not include 1st degree burns in determining**

- 2nd degree burns > 10% BSA.
- 3rd and 4th degree burns.
- Burns involving the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints.
- Electrical burns, including lightning injury.
- Chemical burns.
- Burn injury with inhalation injury.

---

## DESTINATION CONSIDERATIONS

### For patients with burns and concomitant trauma:

- **If the burn injury poses the greatest risk of morbidity or mortality,** consider transporting directly to a Burn Center.
- **If the trauma poses the greater immediate risk,** transport to the closest Trauma Center.

**Patients with inhalation injury or burns to the airway should be transported to the closest Emergency Department for stabilization.**

---

## BURN CENTERS

- **San Jose** – Santa Clara Valley Medical Center Regional Burn Center
- **Fresno** – Community Regional Medical Center Leon S. Peters Burn Center
- **San Francisco** – Bothin Burn Center at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital

---

## PEDIATRIC RULE OF 9'S

### Relative percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) affected by growth

| AREA | NEONATE | 1 YEAR | 5 YEARS | 10 YEARS | 15 YEARS |
|------|---------|--------|---------|----------|----------|
| A/D = 1/2 OF HEAD | 9 ½ % TBSA | 8 ½% TBSA | 6 ½% TBSA | 5 ½% TBSA | 4 ½% TBSA |
| B/E = 1/2 OF ONE THIGH | 2 ¾% TBSA | 3 ¼% TBSA | 4% TBSA | 4 ½% TBSA | 4 ½% TBSA |
| C/F = 1/2 OF ONE LEG | 2 ½% TBSA | 2 ½% TBSA | 2 ¾% TBSA | 3% TBSA | 3 1/4% TBSA |
