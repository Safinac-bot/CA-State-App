PLEURAL DECOMPRESSION
I. PURPOSE
To authorize and provide guidance allowing paramedics to provide pleural decompression
for the patient with signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax or traumatic cardiac arrest
with evidence of chest trauma.
II. POLICY
A. Pleural decompression is indicated for patients with:
1. Clinical signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax and rapidly deteriorating
vital signs, OR
2. Traumatic cardiac arrest with evidence of chest trauma.
B. The preferred site for pleural decompression is the second (2nd) intercostal space at the
midclavicular line on the affected side.
C. If a patient's anatomy or other factors make it difficult to access the midclavicular
approach, an alternative site for pleural decompression in patients 15 years or older is the
fourth or fifth (4th or 5th) intercostal space at the midaxillary line. The insertion site for
pediatric patients (age less than 15) is restricted to the 2nd intercostal space at the
midclavicular line.
D. Patients in traumatic cardiac arrest with evidence of chest trauma should undergo
bilateral pleural decompressions in the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
E. Only one attempt on the affected side shall be made without Base Physician order. In
the event that the first catheter occludes, a second attempt can be made without base
contact.
III. CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX
A. Clinical signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax include a combination of the
following (not all signs may not be present):
1. Severe respiratory distress
2. Diminished breath sounds on the affected side
3. Tracheal deviation away from the affected side
4. Tachycardia
5. Altered Level of Consciousness
6. Jugular vein distention
7. Hypotension

IV. PROCEDURE
A. Procedure for pleural decompression:
1. Draw up 5-6 mL of normal saline into a 10 mL syringe and attach the syringe to a
10-14 gauge IV catheter. (For patients 15 years and older, the catheter length
should be 2.5 - 3.25 inches.)
2. Palpate the appropriate intercostal space and clean the insertion site with
Betadine, alcohol preps, or chlorhexidine.
3. Insert the 10-14 gauge IV catheter (with attached syringe) above the rib and
perpendicular to the appropriate intercostal space. Advance the catheter while
pulling back gently on the plunger of the syringe. If a tension pneumothorax
exists, air will start to fill the syringe when the catheter has entered the pleural
space.
4. Advance the catheter over the needle and remove the needle and syringe from the
catheter.
5. Attach a one-way valve (flutter valve or other appropriate device) to the catheter.
6. Secure the catheter and one-way valve.
V. NOTES
Pleural decompression for pediatric patients (age less than 15) experiencing a tension
pneumothorax with rapidly deteriorating vital signs should be performed using a 1.5-inch
(3.8-cm) 14-16 gauge IV catheter with attached syringe. Insertion site for pediatric patients
is restricted to the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
Assure that the tension pneumothorax is not caused by an occlusive dressing already applied
to the patient. Allow air to escape from the dressed wound prior to using needle
decompression.
When performing a pleural decompression at the 4
th or 5th intercostal space in the
midaxillary line, there is a risk of perforating intra-abdominal organs if the needle is inserted
too low. Needle insertion should be performed superior to the nipple line in men and
superior to the inframammary fold in women. In adults, the correct insertion site is roughly
one hand-width below the axilla (see photo below).
