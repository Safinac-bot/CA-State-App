# AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

---

## ALS AND BLS CARE

---

## ALGORITHM

### Initial Assessment: Respiratory arrest or inadequate ventilation?

**No** → **Routine Medical Care**

- O₂ for SpO₂ < 94%

→ Transport to closest, most appropriate ED

**Yes** → **BLS Airway Measures**

---

## BLS AIRWAY MEASURES

**BLS airway measures include:**
- OPA
- NPA
- BVM
- Suction
- Head-tilt chin lift or jaw thrust maneuvers
- Patient positioning

---

### Decision Point: Airway obstruction?

**No** → Continue to Decision Point 2

**Yes** → **Foreign Body Obstruction Management**

---

## FOREIGN BODY OBSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT

**Initial Actions:**

- **Abdominal thrusts in rapid sequence.** If pt is in the late stages of pregnancy or obese, consider chest thrusts. 
- **If pt becomes unresponsive, begin CPR.** Check mouth for foreign body.

**If unable to remove FB with abdominal/chest thrusts:**

- Use laryngoscope and Magill forceps to remove FB.

---

### Decision Point 2: Airway effective?

**Yes** → Transport to closest, most appropriate ED

**No** → Continue to Advanced Airway Management

---

## ADVANCED AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

**Assist ventilation with BVM as needed.**

**Consider endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway if BLS measures are inadequate.**

- **Capnography required.**

---

### Complete Upper Airway Obstruction

**Perform needle cricothyrotomy on patients with a complete upper airway obstruction (not breathing and unable to ventilate) that cannot be resolved using less-invasive techniques.**

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

> **Defer advanced airway insertion rather than interrupt chest compressions in the cardiac arrest patient.** 
> 
> **After 2 minutes of continuous chest compressions and BVM support, if an immediate endotracheal airway cannot be obtained, consider use of a supraglottic airway.**

---

## TRANSPORT

**Rapid transport to closest ED**
