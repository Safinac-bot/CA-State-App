# CHEST PAIN SUSPECTED CARDIAC ORIGIN
## (Acute Coronary Syndrome)

---

## BLS CARE

- Routine Medical Care
- **Aspirin 324mg PO.** This must be chewable aspirin and not enteric coated.
- **Nitroglycerin 0.4mg SL.** May assist the patient with taking their own NTG if the patient desires and the patient's systolic BP is above 110 mmHg. May repeat every 5 minutes to total of 3 doses if the patient's systolic BP is above 110 mmHg. Do not allow the patient to self-administer if they have used erectile dysfunction medications within the prior 48 hours.

## ALS CARE

### Initial Management

- Routine Medical Care
- Cardiac Monitor
- O₂
- **Aspirin 324 mg PO chewable**, if not previously administered
- **IV**
- **12-Lead ECG**
- **NTG 0.4mg SL** up to 3 doses, q3-5 minutes for continuing pain/discomfort
- Consider **Nitro paste ½ inch transdermal** for prolonged transport
- If pain unrelieved by nitrates, go to **Protocol M-2 Pain Control.**

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point: STEMI?

**Yes** → STEMI Pathway
- Transmit ECG to nearest STEMI Receiving Center
- Transport to closest STEMI Receiving Center

**No** → Non-STEMI Pathway
- Transport to appropriate ED

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

### Nitroglycerin Administration

**Do not administer Nitroglycerin in the following circumstances:**

- Patient has used erectile dysfunction medications (e.g., Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Stendra) within the previous 48 hours.
- Administer nitrates with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with inferior wall MI and suspected right ventricular involvement because these patients require adequate RV preload.

### Special Considerations

- **Use NTG with caution in suspected inferior wall and right-sided MIs.**
- **Oxygen should not be administered when the O₂ sat is 95% or higher unless another condition requiring oxygen is present.**
- If patient is in life-threatening dysrhythmia, go to appropriate protocol.

### STEMI Management

- **On-scene time for STEMI patients should be less than 15 minutes.**
- **Do not delay transport if technical difficulties impede ECG transmission.** Attempt to send enroute whenever possible.
