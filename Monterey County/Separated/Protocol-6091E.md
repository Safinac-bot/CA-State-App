## Performance Objective

Termination of hemodynamically significant tachycardia resulting in restoration of adequate cardiac output and tissue perfusion.

---

## Before performing synchronized cardioversion, paramedics must:

1. Methodically assess the patient's ABC's within 30 seconds.

2. Determine the patient is hemodynamically unstable due to idiopathic (non-compensatory) tachycardia and is a candidate for immediate cardioversion:
   
   a. Confirm the patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms of systemic poor perfusion (including but not limited to hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, dyspnea/tachypnea, diaphoresis, pale/cool skin).
   
   b. Confirm tachycardia (HR greater than 150 in adults, greater than 180 in children, greater than 220 in infants) is present on the ECG.
   
   c. Confirm underlying causes of the dysrhythmia have been considered and reversible causes have been treated.

3. Provide supplemental oxygen in high concentration (10 – 15 LPM).

4. Confirm the ECG monitor leads have been placed appropriately.

5. Differentiate between wide and narrow complex tachycardia.
   
   a. Print Lead II strip prior to performing any medical treatment as this could appear to be a wide complex rhythm when in fact it is a paced rhythm (some monitors do not show pacer spikes).
   
   b. Consider performing a 12 Lead ECG prior to cardioversion if such delay does not cause harm to the patient.

6. Strongly consider midazolam for sedation/amnesic affect for alert patients while preparing cardioversion equipment, but do not delay cardioversion in an unstable patient presenting with signs and symptoms of poor perfusion (hypotension, decreased LOC, chest pain, dyspnea/tachypnea, diaphoresis, pale/cool skin).
   
   a. If IV access is delayed, consider faster alternate routes of administration for midazolam (IN/IM).

7. Explain to patient/family what they can expect to feel and to see while avoiding delays in treatment.

## While performing synchronized cardioversion, paramedics must:

1. Select and prepare the appropriate sites for application of the ECG monitor/defibrillator multifunction pads.
   
   a. Proper pad placement on cleaned, dry skin is essential to minimize pain (heat generated from passage of current through the skin) and maximize current conduction. The better the contact, the more effective attempts at cardioversion will be.

2. Apply the ECG monitor/defibrillator multifunction pads (MFP) firmly to the patient's clean, bare skin in the correct anatomical locations for maximum electrical current flow through the heart.

3. Identify a patient with a pacemaker or automatic internal cardiac defibrillator (AICD) and place the MFP(s) in alternate position(s) to minimize damage to the device(s) and to avoid disruption of current flow through the heart.

4. Place the ECG monitor/defibrillator in synchronize mode.

5. Confirm the monitor is tracking the R wave for delivery of synchronized current.

6. Select the correct energy setting on the ECG monitor/defibrillator per the Monterey County EMS agency protocols

7. Assure everyone is clear from the patient and all possible energy conducting surfaces/contacts.

8. Discharge the defibrillator for synchronized delivery of electrical current.

9. Immediately re-assess the patient.

10. Perform and print a 12 Lead ECG and attach to PCR.

11. Provide treatment based upon re-assessment findings.

## Critical Success Targets for Synchronized Cardioversion

1. Improvement in patient level of consciousness
2. Improved signs of perfusion
3. Resolution of patient's tachycardia-related signs and symptoms (chest pain)
4. ECG return to normal sinus rhythm or sinus tachycardia
5. Proficient use of the ECG monitor/defibrillator including lead and MFP placement
