# NARROW-COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA WITH PULSES

---

## BLS CARE

Follow Routine Medical Care Protocol (M-3)

---

## ALS CARE

### Initial Management

**Identify and treat underlying cause, but do not delay transport.**

**Support the ABCs**
- Maintain patent airway; assist breathing as necessary.
- O₂ – titrate to SpO₂ of >94%
- IV/IO NS
- Cardiac monitor

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Is patient stable?

**Unstable patient criteria:**
- Unconscious or ALOC
- Hypotension
- Signs of shock (SBP < 90 mmHg)

---

### UNSTABLE PATHWAY (No)

**Immediate synchronized cardioversion**

- Cardioversion dosage according to manufacturer's recommendations

→ Transport to closest most appropriate hospital

---

### STABLE PATHWAY (Yes)

**Determine rhythm**

---

### Rhythm Classification

#### 1. Sinus Tachycardia

**Determine and treat cause**

Treatment options:
- **Treat underlying cause**
  - Sepsis
  - Hypovolemia

→ Transport to closest most appropriate hospital

---

#### 2. Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter

**Is patient in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter with Rapid Ventricular Response?**

**Yes:**
- **Consider causes of tachycardia**
- Atrial Fibrillation
- Atrial Flutter

→ **Base Consult**

**No:**
- Continue to SVT pathway

---

#### 3. SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia)

**Treatment:**

1. **Consider vagal maneuvers**

2. **Adenosine 6 mg rapid IVP** followed by rapid bolus of NS

**Effective?**

**Yes:**
- Transport to closest most appropriate hospital
- Consider transport to a STEMI Center if transport time is relatively equal

**No:**
- **Adenosine 12 mg rapid IVP** followed by rapid bolus of NS
  - May repeat x 1

**Still ineffective:**
- Transport to closest most appropriate hospital
