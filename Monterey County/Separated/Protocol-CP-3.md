# TACHYCARDIA WITH PULSES-PEDIATRIC

---

## ALS and BLS CARE

**Routine Medical Care.**

> **Dysrhythmias are uncommon in the pediatric population. The primary cause of cardiac dysrhythmia/arrest in pediatric population is hypoxia or hypovolemia.**

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

- Maintain patent airway; assist breathing as necessary – titrate to SpO₂ of >94%
- Cardiac monitor
- IV/IO - If lung sounds are clear, start NS 20 ml/kg bolus

---

## EVALUATE RHYTHM

**Consider causes: compensatory vs. non-compensatory**

### Probable Sinus Tachycardia

**Rate:**
- <220/min infants
- <180/min children

**Characteristics:**
- P waves present/normal
- R to R - variable
- PR - constant

→ **Treat underlying cause**

→ Consider fluid bolus 20 ml/kg. May repeat once

→ Transport to closest most appropriate Emergency Department

---

### Probable Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)

**Rate:**
- >220/min – infant
- >180/min children

**Characteristics:**
- P waves – absent/abnormal
- Heart rate - constant

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: QRS Duration?

---

## NARROW QRS (< 0.12 sec)

### Decision Point 2: Unstable patient?

**Unstable patient criteria:**
- Unconscious or ALOC
- Hypotension
- Signs of shock

**No (Stable)** → **Stable Narrow QRS Treatment**

**Yes (Unstable)** → **Unstable Treatment**

---

## STABLE NARROW QRS TREATMENT

**Consider vagal maneuver.**

**Consider NS 20 ml/kg fluid bolus**

**Adenosine**
- 0.1 mg/kg rapid IV/IO push (max 1st dose 6 mg)
- May repeat 0.2 mg/kg rapid IV/IO push (max 2nd dose 12 mg) up to two times as needed.

→ Transport to closest most appropriate Emergency Department

---

## WIDE QRS (> 0.12 sec)

> **Wide-complex tachycardia may originate from the ventricle or atria. Adenosine may be helpful for SVT with aberrant conduction.**
>
> **Prehospital use of other antiarrhythmic medications in clinically stable children may worsen the patient's condition and is not recommended.**

---

### Decision Point 3: Stable?

**Yes (Stable)** → **Consider Adenosine**

**Adenosine**
- 0.1 mg/kg rapid IV/IO push (Max 1st dose 6mg)
- May repeat 0.2 mg/kg rapid IV/IO push (Max 2nd dose 12 mg) up to two times as needed

→ Transport to closest most appropriate Emergency Department

---

**No (Unstable)** → **Synchronized Cardioversion**

---

## UNSTABLE TREATMENT (NARROW OR WIDE QRS)

**Base Hospital Contact (prior to synchronized cardioversion)**

**Synchronized cardioversion. Dosage per manufacturer's recommendations.**

**AHA Cardioversion doses:**
- Begin with 0.5–1 J/kg
- If not effective, increase to 2 J/kg

→ Transport to closest most appropriate Emergency Department
