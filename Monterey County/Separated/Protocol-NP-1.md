# SEIZURE-PEDIATRIC

---

## BLS/ALS CARE

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

- Routine Medical Care
- Protect from injury
- Blood glucose check to rule-out seizures secondary to hypoglycemia (See Policy NP-2 for hypoglycemia treatment.)
- Cooling measures if signs of febrile seizure are present. Cooling measures include:
  - Removing clothing and other coverings
  - Cooling with damp towels
  - Fanning to speed evaporation
  - **Do not cool to the point of shivering**
- **Midazolam should be administered as soon as possible for active seizure.**

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Actively seizing?

**No** → **Monitor Patient** → Transport to the most appropriate ED

**Yes** → **Administer Midazolam**

---

## MIDAZOLAM ADMINISTRATION

### Initial Dose

**Midazolam**

**Preferred Route: IM or IN**
- 0.2 mg/kg IM or IN (preferred route), Max dose of 10mg

**Alternative Route: IV**
- 0.1 mg/kg IV, Max dose of 5mg

> **(Do not delay administration of initial dose to establish an IV.)**

---

### Decision Point 2: Persistent active or recurrent seizures?

**No** → **Monitor Patient** → Transport to the most appropriate ED

**Yes** → **Base consult required for additional doses of midazolam.**

---

## NOTES

- **Blood glucose should be checked after initial midazolam dose if not checked previously.**

- **Routine placement of a peripheral IV is recommended after the initial IM or IN dose of midazolam has been administered.**
