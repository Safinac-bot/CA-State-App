- IV/IO NS

> **NOTE - Defibrillation:** Refer to manufacturer's recommendation for energy dose

---

### CPR Cycle Timing

**2 minutes or 5 cycles of CPR. Check rhythm**

- 2 minutes CPR
- 30:2 = 5 cycles
- **Intubated victim:** Continuous compressions, 1 breath every 6 seconds

---

**No** → Go to Protocol C-1: Asystole/PEA or C-7: ROSC

**Yes** → Continue to Second Intervention
