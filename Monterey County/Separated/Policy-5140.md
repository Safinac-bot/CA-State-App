Improvement Committee (TEQIC) meetings.
E. Local Receiving Hospitals shall have:
1. Written transfer agreements (for both adult and pediatric patients) with an appropriate
designated Level I or Level II Trauma Center.
2. Guidelines for identification of patients who should be considered for transfer to a
Trauma Center that are consistent with Monterey County EMS Agency policies and
protocols.
