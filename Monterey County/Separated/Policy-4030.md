PRE-HOSPITAL CONSENT AND REFUSAL OF
SERVICE/CARE
I. PURPOSE
To establish guidelines for obtaining consent to prehospital medical treatment or
transportation, and for dealing with patients who are unable or unwilling to give their
consent.
II. POLICY
General Principles: A person is deemed to have decision-making capacity if they have the
ability to provide informed consent. This requires that the person meet the following criteria:
A. Is an adult (18 years or older) or, if under 18, is legally emancipated.
B. Oriented to person, place, time, and situation.
C. Understands the nature of the illness/injury or risk of injury/illness.
D. Understands the possible risks and consequence of delaying treatment and/or refusing
transport.
E. Exhibits no evidence of intoxication with alcohol and/or drugs.
III. PROCEDURE: REFUSAL OF CARE
Applies to patients who by direct examination, mechanism of injury, or by initiating a patient
relationship by dialing 9-1-1 for medical care for themselves, are refusing medical care
and/or transportation.
A. If the patient is legally and mentally capable of refusing evaluation, treatment, and/or
transport:
1. Reasonable effort should be made to convince the patient to agree to accept the
proposed medical treatment and transport. However, a competent
adult/emancipated minor has the legal right to refuse care.
2. Advise the patient of all risks associated with refusal.
3. Have the patent sign the Release of Medical Responsibility form. A witness shall
also sign. It is preferable to have a relative, friend of the patient, other bystander,
or responder from a separate agency sign as a witness.
4. Consider contacting the Base Hospital for assistance if the patient has a
potentially life-threatening condition, if there is uncertainty about the patient's
capacity to make medical decisions, or if Base Hospital participation is thought to
be beneficial in convincing the patient to accept the proposed medical care or

transport. In these instances, Base Hospital consultation should be directed
towards the specific issues or questions that may impact decision-making and
patient care.
5. Complete a PCR detailing the circumstances of the refusal of care.
B. If the patient is not legally and mentally capable of refusing evaluation, treatment, and/or
transport, determine if an authorized person is available to give consent for the patient.
1. If the authorized representative consents to the proposed medical care, treat and
transport accordingly.
2. If the authorized representative refuses to give consent, follow the process
outlined above for refusal of care and/or transport, having the authorized
representative sign a written refusal of care and/or transport on behalf of the
patient.
3. If the authorized representative is not available, initiate care considered
appropriate for the patient's needs and attempt to contact an authorized
representative.
4. If the patient does not appear to need immediate care or transport, attempt to
contact the authorized representative prior to starting patient care or transport.
This should be done within a reasonable timeframe.
5. If contact with the authorized representative is unavailable, treat the patient under
implied consent.
6. Complete a PCR detailing the circumstances of the refusal of care.
IV. PROCEDURE: REFUSAL OF SERVICE
Refusal of service applies to those individuals with whom no patient-caregiver relationship
has been established and no direct examination of the individual has occurred because the
individual is refusing all EMS services, including an offer of assessment and transportation if
warranted.
A. BLS and ALS personnel may honor a refusal of service.
B. The individual must meet all of the following criteria:
1. Is an adult (18 years or older), or if less than 18 years old, is legally emancipated.
2. Exhibits no evidence of altered level of consciousness or intoxication from
alcohol or drugs.
3. Declines evaluation for potential illness or injury.
C. Actions to be taken include the following:
1. Honor the refusal.
2. Complete a PCR detailing the circumstances of the refusal of service.
3. If multiple individuals at one event refuse service, document each name on one
PCR. It is not necessary to complete a separate PCR for each individual who
refuses service.

V.NOTES
A. A minor who presents written evidence of legal emancipation can personally refuse
prehospital medical treatment as described above. This evidence can be either a written
Declaration of Emancipation from the County Superior Court, or an Identification Card
from the Department of Motor Vehicles indicating emancipation.
B. A person detained under California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5150, or
someone under arrest, does not, by that fact alone, lose the authority to make decisions
regarding prehospital medical treatment. No person may be presumed to lack capacity
solely because they have been evaluated or treated for mental disorder, regardless of
whether such evaluation or treatment was voluntarily or involuntarily received.
C. If a patient is treated or transported without consent, based on the belief that the patient
lacked sufficient capacity to make a healthcare decision, then patient care documentation
must reflect the reason or reasons for this belief and show why this belief was reasonable.
