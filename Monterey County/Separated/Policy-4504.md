Monterey County EMS System Policy
Policy Number: 4504
Effective Date: 7/1/2025
Review Date: 6/30/2028
DROWNING AND NON-FATAL DROWNING
I. PURPOSE
To define the principles of care for drowning, non-fatal drowning, and diving emergencies.
II. POLICY
A. EMS personnel are to follow employer policy regarding water rescue.
B. Routine use of a backboard is discouraged except as needed for extrication and patient
movement. Spinal Motion Restriction should be considered for mechanism of injury
such as diving into shallow water.
III. PROCEDURE
A. Ensure scene and rescuer safety. Call appropriate public safety agencies: fire, rescue, or
police teams, including scuba teams to properly stabilize the scene and safely rescue the
victim(s) from the source of submersion. Consider need for additional EMS unit(s) for
rescuer rehabilitation and/or treatment.
B. Maintain an open airway immediately upon obtaining access to the patient. Ensure spinal
stabilization and immobilization if indicated (i.e., un-witnessed event, unconscious
patient, or mechanism of injury). Assist ventilations as needed.
C. Determine patient's hemodynamic stability and symptoms. Continually assess Level of
Consciousness, ABCs and Vital Signs. Treat all life-threatening conditions as they
become identified. Initiate CPR when appropriate.
D. The following guidelines should be used by EMS providers to guide their decision about
whether to perform CPR on drowning victims with prolonged submersion:
1. Submersion less than 90 minutes in water less than 43 degrees Fahrenheit: Begin
CPR and transport.
2. Submersion greater than 90 minutes in water less than 43 degrees Fahrenheit:
CPR may be withheld.
3. Submersion less than 30 minutes in water greater than 43 degrees Fahrenheit:
Begin CPR and transport.
4. Submersion greater than 30 minutes in water greater than 43 degrees Fahrenheit:
CPR may be withheld.
5. If the submersion time is unknown and there are no obvious findings incompatible
with life (e.g., advanced decomposition, separation of vital organs from the body),
begin CPR and transport.

6. Initiate CPR for cardiac arrest for scuba diving emergencies unless time of arrest
can be determined.
E. If near-drowning incident involves a scuba diver, suggesting barotrauma, consider
utilization of hyperbaric treatment facility.
F. For viable patients and those receiving CPR, initiate transport as soon as possible.
G. Encourage the patient to accept transport after a non-fatal drowning due to the potential
for delayed respiratory problems.
