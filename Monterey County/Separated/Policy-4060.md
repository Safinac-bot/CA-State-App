PHYSICIAN ON SCENE
I. PURPOSE
This policy provides direction for prehospital personnel when, at the scene of injury or
illness, a bystander identifies themselves as a physician and wants to be involved in the care
of the patient.
II. PROCEDURE FOR PHYSICIAN INVOLVEMENT
A. If a bystander identifies themselves as a physician and wants to be involved in the care of
the patient, prehospital personnel should show the physician the card issued by the State
of California entitled "Note to Physician on Involvement with Paramedics" (attached)
and ask the physician to select one of the three options provided.
B. If the physician on scene desires option one (1), medical control remains with the
protocols established by the Monterey County EMS Agency Medical Director and, as
needed, the Base Hospital physician.
C. If the physician on scene desires option two (2), prehospital personnel shall:
1. Ask to see the physician's valid California medical license, unless prehospital
personnel already know the physician from prior professional interactions.
2. Immediately contact the Base Hospital and allow the physician on scene to speak
with the Base Hospital physician. If there is disagreement between the physician
on scene and the Base Hospital physician regarding the medical care required,
EMS providers shall remain in control of patient care under the medical direction
of the Base Hospital physician.
3. If the physician on scene performs a procedure or continues to engage in direct
patient care after the arrival of EMS, such involvement is categorized as option
three (3) and requires the elements listed under Section II (D) below.
D. If the physician on scene desires option three (3), performs a procedure, or continues to
engage in direct patient care after the arrival of EMS, in addition to the items in Section II
(C) above, prehospital personnel shall:
1. Make equipment and supplies available to the physician and offer assistance.
2. Ensure the physician accompanies the patient in the ambulance to the receiving
hospital.
3. Ensure the physician signs the EMS Patient Care Report for all instructions and
medical care given.
