# CARDIAC ARREST - ASYSTOLE/PEA

---

## BLS CARE

- Follow Routine Medical Care Protocol (M-3).
- Begin CPR.
- Consider and treat potential causes of the patient's condition.
- Apply AED immediately when available. Continue CPR during application of the AED pads.
- Continue CPR for two minutes.
- AED Rhythm check and Assess for spontaneous circulation.
- Continue resuscitation efforts if no return of spontaneous circulation.

## ALS CARE

### DURING CPR:

- **Continuous CPR for at least 2 minutes**
- **O₂ High Flow**
- **Monitor EtCO₂ (Mandatory)**
- **IV/IO**
- **NS 500 ml bolus**

### Medications:

**Epinephrine 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/ml)**
- 1 mg IV/IO
- Repeat every 3-5 minutes

### Airway Management:

- Intubate or place supraglottic airway
- Consider and treat reversible causes

---

## REVERSIBLE CAUSES

- **H**ypovolemia
- **H**ypoxia
- **H**ydrogen ions (Acidosis)
- **H**ypo/Hyperkalemia
- **H**ypothermia
- **H**ypoglycemia
- **T**ablets or Toxins
- **T**amponade
- **T**ension pneumothorax
- **T**hrombosis (MI, CVA)
- **T**hromboembolism (PE)

---

## ALGORITHM FLOW

### Decision Point 1: Rhythm Check

**Shockable rhythm?**

- **Yes** → Go to Protocol C-2: V fib/V Tach
- **No** → Continue to Decision Point 2

### Decision Point 2: ROSC Check

**Organized rhythm and pulse present?**

- **Yes** → Go to Protocol C-7: ROSC
- **No** → Continue CPR

---

## TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION

### Continue CPR

Consider:
- **Discontinue CPR**
  
  OR
  
- **Continue CPR/Transport**

### Special Considerations*

**Consider transport or base hospital contact before discontinuing CPR for the following patients:**

- Patient is age 50 or younger.
- No obvious precipitating cause of cardiac arrest.
- Intermittent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.
- Persistent PEA at a rate greater than 40/min.
- Persistent ETCO₂ >20 or rising ETCO₂

> **Note:** Patients in cardiac arrest due to hypothermia shall be transported.

## SPECIAL PROTOCOLS

**Use Protocol T-5 for Cardiac Arrest from Trauma**
