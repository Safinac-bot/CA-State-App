TRANSFER OF PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY
I. PURPOSE
This policy establishes the guidelines for transfer of patient care responsibility in the
prehospital setting.
II. POLICY
A. EMS personnel shall seek to ensure continuity of patient care through effective
communication of patient history, physical exam and patient assessment findings,
diagnostic signs, treatment provided, patient response, and any other relevant information
to the healthcare providers taking over patient care responsibilities.
III. PROCEDURE
A. When a patient is being treated by BLS level personnel, ALS level personnel arriving at
the scene are responsible for contacting the BLS personnel, obtaining patient information,
and ensuring coordination of care with BLS personnel. During this transfer of
information, ALS personnel shall assume responsibility for patient care. ALS personnel
may directly approach the patient to initiate ALS level patient assessment and care as
needed based on patient need.
B. When first responder paramedics arrive on scene first, they may either transfer patient
care authority to the transport paramedic or maintain primary patient care responsibility
until care is transferred to a flight crew or at the hospital. This decision shall be made
immediately upon arrival of the transport paramedic. The decision shall be
communicated verbally by the first response paramedic and shall be verbally
acknowledged by the transport paramedic. If the first response paramedic does not
communicate the decision, the transport paramedic should confirm which paramedic will
have primary patient care responsibility.
C. The transport paramedic is to assist with patient care should the first response paramedic
maintain primary patient care responsibilities.
D. If a conflict regarding patient care occurs that cannot be resolved amongst the personnel,
contact the base hospital physician for direction.
E. EMS System first responders shall locate, assess, and treat patients prior to the arrival of
EMS transport providers. To maximize patient safety and to ensure adequate assistance
for EMS transport providers, first responders shall remain on scene to assist EMS
transport providers until verbally cleared by EMS transport providers to return to service.
When responding to healthcare facilities such as physician offices and skilled nursing
facilities, first responders shall remain at the scene to provide assistance until cleared by
EMS transport providers, even if facility staff advise first responders that their services
are not required.

F. Whenever one paramedic assumes care from another, both individuals must complete and
file a Patient Care Report (PCR). The time of transfer of care should be documented on
the PCR.
G. Any paramedic unit taking over patient care from another paramedic unit should,
whenever possible, resupply the first paramedic unit according to the ambulance provider
resupply offer.
