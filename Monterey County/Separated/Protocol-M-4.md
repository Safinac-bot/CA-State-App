# SEPSIS

---

## ALS and BLS CARE

### Initial Management

- Consider contact, droplet, and airborne precautions
- Routine Medical Care (Protocol M-3)
- Oxygen - Titrate to SpO₂ > 94%
- Consider CPAP for moderate to severe associated respiratory distress/crackles
- **Avoid CPAP and nebulized treatments for patient with possible airborne transmissible infections disease (COVID, TB, etc)**
- Obtain blood sugar
- Apply cardiac monitor and capnography

---

## ALGORITHM

### Evaluate potential SIRS criteria:

- Known recent fever, suspected fever or measured temperature > 100.4°F (38°C) or < 96.8°F (36°C)
- HR > 90
- RR > 20
- EtCO₂ < 25 mmHg

---

### Decision Point: Two or more criteria met?

**No** → Consider other condition appropriate protocol. Transport to the closest ED.

**Yes** → SEPSIS ALERT Management

---

## SEPSIS ALERT MANAGEMENT

**Administer IV/IO fluids:**

- 500 mL NS bolus
- Repeat as needed to SBP > 90 mmHg or MAP > 65 mmHg
- Total max fluid dose of 30 mL/kg
- Frequently reassess hemodynamic status and lung sounds

**Notify the receiving hospital of a SEPSIS ALERT**

→ Transport to appropriate ED

## PRINCIPLES OF SEPSIS

- **Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition** characterized by a whole-body inflammatory state called Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS).

- Sepsis can occur due to microbes in the blood, urine, lungs, skin, or other tissues.

- SIRS can cause fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.

- **Quantitative waveform capnography can be a reliable surrogate for lactate monitoring.** EtCO₂ < 25 mmHg is associated with serum lactate levels > 4 mmol/L.

- **Early recognition and treatment of these patients is key to improving patient outcomes.** EMS focus is on recognition, aggressive fluid administration, and maintaining oxygenation.
