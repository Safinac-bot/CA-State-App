# WIDE-COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA WITH PULSES

---

## BLS CARE

Follow Routine Medical Care Protocol (M-3)

---

## ALS CARE

### Initial Management

**Identify and treat underlying cause, but do not delay transport.**

**Support the ABCs:**
- Maintain patent airway; assist breathing as necessary
- O₂ – titrate to SpO₂ of > 94%
- IV/IO NS
- Cardiac Monitor
- 12 Lead EKG - Do not delay critical interventions

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Is the patient stable?

**Unstable criteria:**
- Unconscious or ALOC
- Hypotension (Systolic BP less than 90)
- Other signs of shock

---

### UNSTABLE PATHWAY (No)

**Immediate synchronized cardioversion** using manufacturer's recommended energy setting

**12-Lead if not previously performed**

**Continued V-tach?**

**Yes:**
- **Repeat cardioversion at increased Joules** per manufacturer's recommendation

**No:**
- Transport to nearest STEMI Receiving Center

---

### STABLE PATHWAY (Yes)

**12-Lead if not previously performed**

**Determine rhythm:**

---

### Rhythm Classification Path 1: V-Tach?

**No** → Continue to next decision point

**Yes** → **Torsades de pointes?**

#### If Torsades de pointes (Yes):

**Magnesium Sulfate 2 grams in 50 or 100 ml NS IV/IO over 15 minutes**

→ Transport to nearest STEMI Receiving Center

#### If NOT Torsades de pointes (No):

**Treatment options (Choose one):**

- **Lidocaine 1 mg/kg IV/IO bolus.** May repeat 0.5mg/kg every 5 minutes up to 3mg/kg total
  
  **OR**
  
- **Amiodarone 150 mg IV/IO over 10 minutes**

**Consider Co-administration**

**Persistent wide-complex tachycardia?**

**Yes:**
- **Base Consult if wide complex tachycardia unresolved**

**No:**
- Transport to nearest STEMI Receiving Center

---

### Rhythm Classification Path 2: A-fib or flutter?

**Yes:**
- **Base Consult**

**No:**
- Continue assessment

---

### Treatment for Persistent Wide-Complex Tachycardia

**Treatment options (Choose one):**

- **Lidocaine 1 mg/kg IV/IO bolus.** May repeat 0.5mg/kg every 5 minutes up to 3mg total
  
  **OR**
  
- **Amiodarone 150 mg IV/IO over 10 minutes**

→ Transport to nearest STEMI Receiving Center

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

**Consider additional causes of wide-complex tachycardia** such as tricyclic antidepressant OD. Follow Protocol E-5 Overdose and Poisoning if signs and symptoms of OD are present.
