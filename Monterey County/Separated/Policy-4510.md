Monterey County EMS System Policy
Policy Number: 4510
Effective Date: 7/1/2024
Review Date: 6/30/2027
TOURNIQUET
I. PURPOSE
A. To specify the indications for the use of tourniquets.
II. POLICY
A. Tourniquets may be used for significant active bleeding in an extremity according to the
indications listed below.
B. Monterey County EMS Service providers may stock only commercially-manufactured
tourniquets. Tourniquets may be improvised for use when the number of patients or extent of
injuries deplete the stock of tourniquets available at the scene.
C. Tourniquet use is approved for paramedics, EMTs, EMRs, and trained public safety personnel.
III. INDICATIONS
A. A tourniquet should be used in the following situations:
1. In the presence of significant active bleeding
a) When direct pressure is unable to control the bleeding.
b) In the presence of impaled/penetrating objects when direct pressure is unable to
be used to control bleeding.
c) When direct pressure has the potential to cause further injury to a mangled
extremity.
2. In the presence of multiple patients and the time needed to control bleeding through
direct pressure would potentially interfere with other lifesaving activities.
3. In the tactical environment when scene safety is a concern. In this situation a tourniquet
may be used as the initial method to control active bleeding.
IV. PROCEDURE
A. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for application.
B. Do not apply a tourniquet over a joint.
C. Do not apply a tourniquet over a fracture or suspected fracture.
D. Apply the tourniquet at least 2-3 inches proximal to the injury/bleeding site.
E. Tighten the tourniquet enough to stop the bleeding or until a distal pulse cannot be felt.
F. Reassess for bleeding.

1. If bleeding from the wound starts after the tourniquet has been placed, attempt to control
the bleeding with direct pressure to the wound or tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding
stops.
G. A second tourniquet may be utilized if bleeding is unable to be controlled with the first
tourniquet. The second tourniquet should be placed next to and proximal to the first tourniquet.
Do not remove the first tourniquet after applying the second tourniquet.
H. Do not remove the tourniquet once it is in place, except by physician's order.
1. If an improvised tourniquet prevents placement of a commercial tourniquet due to its
location, it may be removed prior to placement of the commercial tourniquet.
I. Consider medication for pain management.
J. Remove any jewelry, clothing, etc. from the affected extremity.
K. During transfer of patient care to another provider, clearly identify the presence of and
location(s) of any tourniquet(s).
V. NOTES
A. If it is necessary to improvise a tourniquet, the improvised tourniquet should be at least 2 inches
in width. Elastic-type materials that stretch should be avoided.
B. Poorly applied or unnecessary tourniquets applied by bystanders or lesser-trained personnel may
be removed by EMS personnel. If there is uncontrolled bleeding, a new tourniquet should be
applied.
