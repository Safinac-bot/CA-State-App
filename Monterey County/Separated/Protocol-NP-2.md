## ALS and BLS CARE

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

**Routine Medical Care (Protocol MP-2)**

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: BGL < 70 mg/dL OR known diabetic with altered mental status?

**No** → Monitor Patient → Transport to the most appropriate ED

**Yes** → Continue to Decision Point 2

> **If hypoglycemia still most likely cause of the patient's condition despite normal reading on glucometer, administer glucose regardless, while considering other causes of altered mental status**

---

### Decision Point 2: Can the patient safely tolerate oral glucose?

**Yes** → **Oral Glucose Administration**

**No** → Continue to Decision Point 3

---

## ORAL GLUCOSE PATHWAY

**Administer Glucose Paste 15 gm (½ tube) PO or other oral glucose containing solution**

→ Transport to the most appropriate ED

---

### Decision Point 3: Can IV access be established?

**No** → **Glucagon Administration**

**Yes** → Continue to IV Dextrose Pathway

---

## GLUCAGON PATHWAY

**Consider Glucagon:**
- **< 20 kg:** 0.5 mg IM
- **≥ 20 kg:** 1 mg IM

**OR establish IO access for Dextrose**

---

## IV DEXTROSE PATHWAY

**Administer Dextrose:**
- **Neonates:** 10% at 2 cc/kg IV/IO
- **Pediatric:** 25% at 2 cc/kg IV/IO
- **Maximum dose of 50 cc**

> **If Dextrose 10% is not available due to supply chain shortages, Dextrose 12.5% may be substituted at the same dose**

---

### Decision Point 4: Is the patient still symptomatic?

**No** → Monitor Patient → Transport to the most appropriate ED

**Yes** → **Reassess Patient**

---

### Reassess Patient

**Symptoms resolved?**

**Yes** → Monitor Patient → Transport to the most appropriate ED

**No** → Continue to repeat dose consideration

---

### Repeat Dose

**May repeat initial Dextrose dose once if BGL remains below 70 mg/dL and altered mental status continues**

**Consider other causes of altered mental status**

→ Monitor Patient → Transport to the most appropriate ED
