**If legs are delivered:**
- Gently elevate trunk and legs to aid delivery of head.
- Head should deliver in 30 seconds. If not, place a gloved hand in the vagina and form a "V" around the mouth and nose to maintain the airway.

**If infant delivered,** see Childbirth Protocol (O-1) – Postpartum care of infant and mother

**Considerations:**
- Unlikely that the baby will deliver spontaneously or that the EMS provider will be able to effectively assist in the delivery.

### Prolapsed Umbilical Cord

**Treatment:**

- Discourage pushing by mother.
