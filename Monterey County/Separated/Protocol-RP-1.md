# AIRWAY MANAGEMENT–PEDIATRIC

---

## ALS AND BLS

---

## ALGORITHM

### Decision Point 1: Respiratory arrest or inadequate ventilation?

**No** → **Routine Medical Care**

- Continue with BLS measures and O₂ to maintain SpO₂ at >94%
- Oxygen to maintain SpO₂ >94%

→ Transport

**Yes** → **BLS Airway Measures**

---

## BLS AIRWAY MEASURES

**BLS airway measures include:**
- OPA
- NPA
- BVM
- Head-tilt or jaw thrust maneuvers
- Patient positioning

---

### Decision Point 2: Airway obstruction?

**No** → Continue to Decision Point 3

**Yes** → **Foreign Body Obstruction Management**

---

## FOREIGN BODY OBSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT

### Decision Point: Suspected epiglottitis?

**Yes** → **Epiglottitis Management**

**No** → **Standard Foreign Body Removal**

---

## EPIGLOTTITIS MANAGEMENT

**Position of comfort.**

**If pt deteriorates or becomes completely obstructed, positive pressure ventilation.**

→ Rapid transport to closest ED

---

## STANDARD FOREIGN BODY REMOVAL

**Abdominal thrusts in rapid sequence.**
- If pt is obese, consider chest thrusts. 
- **For patients < 1 year, deliver five back blows followed by five chest thrusts.**

**If pt becomes unresponsive, begin CPR. Check mouth for FB.**

**If unable to remove FB with abdominal/chest thrusts, use laryngoscope and Magill Forceps to remove FB**

---

### Decision Point 3: Airway effective?

**Yes** → Continue with BLS measures → Transport

**No** → **Advanced Airway Management**

---

## ADVANCED AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

**Assist ventilation with BVM as needed**

**Consider supraglottic airway**

---

### Complete Upper Airway Obstruction

**Perform needle cricothyrotomy on patients 1 year or older with a complete upper airway obstruction (not breathing and unable to ventilate) that cannot be resolved using less-invasive techniques.**

---

## TRANSPORT

**Rapid transport to closest ED**
