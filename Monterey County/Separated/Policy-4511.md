MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT DEVICES
I. PURPOSE
To provide guidance and standardization regarding prehospital management of the patient
with a Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) device.
II. OVERVIEW OF MCS DEVICES:
A. Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)
1. The VAD assists the native ventricle-pumping action and provides the cardiac
output needed to survive.
2. These devices are either pulsatile or continuous-flow (non-pulsatile).
3. They are further divided into Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD), Right
Ventricular Assist Devices (RVAD), or Bi-Ventricular Assist Devices (BiVAD).
4. The most common device is a continuous-flow pump located in the patient's
thorax or upper abdomen and attached to the patient's left ventricle and aorta
(LVAD).
5. VAD patients typically have no pulse because the device is continuously flowing.
This will alter your assessments, as pulse oximetry and blood pressure cuffs do
not generally work accurately.
6. Properly functioning VADs emit a humming noise that can be auscultated with a
stethoscope.
7. The "driveline" or cable connecting the VAD to an external controller usually
exits the patient's left upper quadrant of the abdomen and attaches to the
controller, which is worn on the patient's belt or in a fanny pack.
8. The controller is attached to a power source (either batteries or a 120-volt power
source).
B. Total Artificial Heart (TAH)
1. The TAH is a pulsatile device that replaces both ventricles of the heart. It is
attached to a power source called the "Freedom Driver" via two lines running
from the chest through the abdomen to an external power source.
2. If the device is functioning, you will hear an audible "gallop" indicating that the
device is pumping.
3. TAH patients will have a palpable pulse, so blood pressure and pulse oximetry
measurements will be accurate.
C. VAD and TAH
1. Information regarding the type of device, the implanting hospital, and/or the
VAD/MCS Coordinator contact telephone/pager number may be on a tag on the
device, on the refrigerator, or on a medical alert bracelet.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4511
2. Unless it is absolutely necessary, do not remove the sterile dressing covering the
driveline at the abdomen and/or lower chest.
III. ASSESSMENT OF A PATIENT WITH AN MCS
A. Assess the patient prior to assessing the device.
1. VAD Patient
a. Because these patients likely will have no pulses, use other parameters for
assessment (e.g., skin signs, level of consciousness, capillary refill,
EtC02).
2. TAH Patient
a. These patients will have a pulse and a blood pressure.
B. Use the AHA's C-A-B recommendations with one addition:
1. Circulation / Connections (device)
2. Airway
3. Breathing
C. Assess to see if the device is working:
1. VAD patient: Auscultate the patient's chest and left upper quadrant of the
abdomen. A "humming" noise indicates that the VAD is working.
2. TAH patient: An audible "gallop" indicates that the device is working. The
sound can usually be heard without the assistance of a stethoscope.
3. Assess the device for any alarms:
a. VAD:
1) The computer controller driving the device will be attached to the
driveline. This controller should have a green light or should
display the liters per minute of blood flow.
2) The patient will either have the device plugged into batteries worn
on his/her person or to a 120-volt power source.
b. TAH:
1) The Freedom Driver will display battery status information as well
as temperature or fault alarms.
4. Check all connections from the driveline to the device and the power source to
ensure that nothing has become disconnected.
5. Low battery charge is one of the most common reasons for a device to alarm
or stop working properly. Always check the charge on the batteries to
ensure that they are adequately charged, and replace them with a fully
charged battery, if needed.
6. Continue to assess the patient in conjunction with your VAD/TAH assessment.
IV. CONTACT BASE HOSPITAL
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4511
A. Base Hospital contact shall be made as early as possible. Consider establishing base
contact while on scene unless transport time is greater than 20 minutes. Be prepared to
give the following information to the Base Hospital:
1. Name of implanting hospital
2. Phone number or pager number for the VAD/MCS Coordinator
a. The Base Hospital will need to contact the VAD/MCS Coordinator to
obtain directions to give to EMS personnel.
b. Orders may only be accepted from the Base Hospital, not from the
VAD/MCS Coordinator.
V. MEDICAL CARE
A. All MCS patients:
1. Standard airway management
2. Administer oxygen as clinically indicated
3. IV initiation – prepare for orders for fluid resuscitation.
4. Full arrest – interventions are device dependent. See below for further details.
5. Pain management medications are appropriate.
B. VAD patients
1. An ECG will show the patient's native heart rhythm, which may not be indicative
of their current circulatory status.
a. The patient could potentially be in a lethal heart rhythm, such as VT or VF
while conscious.
2. Chest compressions, external pacing, cardioversion, and defibrillation are
permissible.
a. Mechanical CPR devices should not be utilized unless cleared by the Base
Hospital or MCS Coordinator.
3. Avoid Nitroglycerin and aspirin in VAD patients.
C. TAH Patients
1. An EKG will show asystole as these patients do not have ventricles.
2. DO NOT perform chest compressions, external pacing, cardioversion, or
defibrillation.
3. TAH patients are instructed to take nitroglycerin SL if their systolic blood
pressure is >140 mmHg. Contact the Base Hospital for orders.
D. For treatment questions, contact the Base Hospital.
VI. TRAUMA PATIENTS WITH AN MCS DEVICE
A. These patients are likely on anticoagulants. Maintain an elevated index of suspicion for
internal hemorrhage.
Monterey County EMS System Policy 4511
B. Let the Trauma Center know that the patient has an MCS device.
C. Treat the trauma per protocol. Do not let the MCS guide the treatment.
VII. TRANSPORT
A. When possible, MCS patients should be transported to the implanting hospital.
B. Follow Base Hospital order for transport.
1. If the patient is in-extremis (e.g., if CPR is indicated or if the patient is
unconscious / unresponsive with poor skin signs or decreased capillary refill),
transport to the closest emergency department.
C. Always take all the patient's additional equipment for the MCS with you to the hospital.
D. Bring the patient's caregiver with you to the hospital if they are present. They have been
trained in the device and are important resources during the patient's care.
VAD and TAH Differences
Ventricular Assist Device Total Artificial Heart
Usually pulseless Pulsatile
ECG shows native heart rhythm ECG is meaningless since there are
no ventricles
Pulse oximetry is inaccurate or absent Pulse oximetry is accurate
Do not use nitroglycerin Patients are ordered to use
nitroglycerin for systolic blood
pressure >140 mmHg
Chest compressions may be performed if needed No chest compressions
May perform trancutaneous pacing, cardioversion, or
defibrillation if indicated
Do NOT pace, cardiovert, or
defibrillate
Auscultate the left upper quadrant of the patient's
abdomen for the "hum" of the VAD
The TAH's Freedom Driver is
audible without a stethoscope, and
makes a "galloping" sound.
Usually have an ICD Do not have an ICD
Obtaining a blood pressure measurement using a BP
cuff and stethoscope is not possible. Use a noninvasive blood pressure device if available. A normal
MAP is 70 – 90 mmHg.
Blood pressure is obtainable utilizing
a normal sphygmomanometer.
