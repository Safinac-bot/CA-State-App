BASE HOSPTIAL COMMUNCIATION FAILURE
I. PURPOSE
To authorize the provision of medications and procedures that require base physician contact under
Monterey County EMS policies and protocols when voice communication with the base hospital
cannot be established or maintained and a delay in the treatment may jeopardize the life of a patient.
II. POLICY
A. In the event a paramedic is unable to establish or maintain voice contact with the Base Hospital
to obtain direction for treatments requiring base physician contact and reasonably determines that
a delay in treatment may jeopardize patient outcome, the paramedic may initiate any of the ALS
procedures for which they have been trained and are included in Monterey County EMS policies
and protocols. The paramedic may initiate the treatment indicated based on patient needs.
B. The paramedic will continue attempts to establish and maintain direct voice contact with the
Base Hospital while enroute to the receiving facility. Upon establishing contact, the paramedic
will report on the patient's condition, treatment initiated, and patient response.
C. Upon arrival at the receiving facility, the paramedic will make a verbal report to the on-duty
emergency physician or receiving nurse in the emergency department.
D. The paramedic will complete an Unusual Occurrence Report form and submit it to the EMS
Agency within 24 hours of the incident. The Base Hospital will also complete an Unusual
Occurrence form and submit it to the EMS Agency. The reports will include the suspected cause
of the communication failure.
E. The Base Hospital Medical Director and/or Base Hospital Coordinator will review the incident
and contact EMS by phone if the incident requires immediate follow-up.
