# CARDIAC ARREST-VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION/PULSELESS VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA-PEDIATRIC

---

## BLS CARE

- Routine Medical Care.
- **Apply AED immediately when available.** Continue chest compressions during application of the AED pads. 
- **AED use for age 1 and older only.** 
- AED pads must not touch after placement on the patient.
- **Continue CPR for two minutes even if shock is delivered.**
- AED rhythm check and assess for spontaneous circulation.
- If return of spontaneous circulation, treat the patient based on condition.

## ALS CARE

---

## INITIAL MANAGEMENT

**Routine Medical Care.**

**Witnessed/Unwitnessed Arrest:**
- CPR until defibrillator available/charged
- O₂ high flow
- Cardiac monitor
- EtCO₂
- IV/IO NS

---

## FIRST SHOCK SEQUENCE

**Defibrillate** (see note)

**Resume CPR for 2 minutes**

### CPR - 2 minutes
- 30:2 (5 cycles, 1 rescuer)
- 15:2 (10 cycles, 2 rescuers)

**Check rhythm**

---

### Decision Point 1: Shockable rhythm?

**No** → **Go to CP-1: Asystole/PEA**

**Yes** → Continue to Second Shock Sequence

---

## SECOND SHOCK SEQUENCE

**CPR while defibrillator charging**

**Defibrillate** (see note)

**Resume CPR for 2 minutes**

**Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg of the 1:10,000 concentration IV/IO.**
- Administer as early as possible. 
- Repeat every 3-5 minutes

> **Do not interrupt CPR to administer medications.**

---

### Decision Point 2: Shockable rhythm?

**No** → **Go to CP-1: Asystole/PEA**

**Yes** → Continue to Third Shock Sequence

---

## THIRD SHOCK SEQUENCE AND BEYOND

**CPR while defibrillator charging**

**Defibrillate** (see note)

**Resume CPR for 2 minutes**

---

### Antiarrhythmic Medications

**Lidocaine 1 mg/kg IV/IO**
- May repeat every 5-10 minutes to maximum of 3 mg/kg

**OR**

**Amiodarone 5 mg/kg bolus (not to exceed 300 mg) IV/IO**
- May repeat 5 mg/kg in 5 minutes up to 15 mg/kg total dose if dysrhythmia persists

---

### Continue Cycle

**Continue CPR cycles with rhythm checks every 2 minutes**

**Repeat epinephrine every 3-5 minutes**

---

### Decision Point 3: Pulses present?

**Yes** → **Go to CP-7: ROSC**

**No** → Continue resuscitation

---

## TRANSPORT DECISION

**Transport after 2 rounds of medications or 10-15 minutes of high-quality CPR**

**Transport to closest ED**

---

## **DEFIBRILLATION NOTE

**Defibrillation Energy Levels:**

- **First shock:** 2 J/kg
- **Second shock:** 4 J/kg
- **Subsequent shocks:** >4 J/kg with maximum 10 J/kg or adult dose
