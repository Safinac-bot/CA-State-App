## I. Definition

A. None.

   b. Continue CPR as indicated and refer to procedure guideline 7909 Cardiac Arrest Management.

### Adult

**A. Airway obstruction:**

1. Conscious patient unable to speak or cough:
   a. Administer continuous abdominal thrusts until foreign object is expelled, air movement is restored, or the patient becomes unconscious.

2. Unconscious or becomes unconscious patient:
   a. If unable to maintain an airway or ventilate after two attempts with BLS maneuver:
      (1) Attempt supraglottic airway per procedure guideline 7912 Supraglottic Airway.

### Pediatric (less than 14 years of age)

**A. Airway obstruction:**

1. Conscious patient unable to speak or cough:
   a. Infant < 1 year old:
      (1) Place infant in a head down position supporting the head.
      (2) Administer 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts continuously until foreign object is expelled, air movement is restored, or the patient becomes unconscious.
   b. Child > 1 year old:
      (1) Refer to adult treatment.

## III. Advanced Life Support

**A. Airway obstruction:**

1. Inspect oral cavity:
   a. If object seen, use forceps and attempt to remove.

### Adult

**A. Airway obstruction:**

1. If unable to maintain an airway or ventilate after two attempts with BLS maneuver:
   a. Attempt oral endotracheal intubation per procedure guidelines 7911 Endotracheal Intubation

**B. Bronchospasm:**

1. Administer Albuterol 5 mg in 6 ml NS and Atrovent 0.5 mg in 3 ml NS via appropriate nebulizer device.
   a. Repeat Albuterol if symptoms persist.
   b. Do not repeat Atrovent.

2. If severe bronchospasm:
   a. Administer 1:1,000 Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM.

3. If respiratory arrest appears imminent, consider 1:10,000 Epinephrine 0.1 mg slow IVP.
   a. May repeat four (4) times as indicated at two (2) minute intervals.

**C. Congestive heart failure or acute pulmonary edema:**

1. Administer Nitroglycerin:
   a. If SBP > 100 mmHg administer 0.4 mg SL.
   b. If SBP > 150 mmHg administer 0.8 mg SL.
   c. May repeat every 5 minutes to max of 2.4 mg.
   d. For prolonged transports (greater than 60 minutes) apply 2% Nitroglycerine paste Â½ inch.
      (1) May repeat once if symptoms persist and SBP > 100 mmHg.

2. Apply CPAP per procedure guideline 7908 CPAP.

3. If wheezing or diminished lung sounds are present, administer Albuterol 5 mg in 6 ml NS and Atrovent 0.5 mg in 3 ml NS via appropriate inline nebulizer device.
   a. Repeat albuterol as indicated.
   b. Do not repeat Atrovent.

### Pediatric (less than 14 years of age)

**A. Airway obstruction:**

1. If unable to maintain an airway or ventilate after two attempts with BLS maneuver:
   a. Attempt supraglottic airway per procedure guideline 7912 Supraglottic Airway.

**B. Bronchospasm:**

1. Administer Albuterol per pediatric medication administration guide via appropriate inline nebulizer device.
   a. Repeat Albuterol if symptoms persist.

2. If severe bronchospasm:
   a. Administer Atrovent per pediatric medication administration guide via appropriate nebulizer device.

3. If patient is apneic or has inadequate tidal volume:
   a. Consider CPAP if age appropriate.
   b. Administer 1:1,000 Epinephrine IM per pediatric medication administration guide.
   c. If further deterioration anticipated or observed:
      (1) Administer 1:10,000 Epinephrine slow IVP per pediatric medication administration guide.
          (a) May repeat every 10 minutes.
          (b) Max dose 0.1 mg.

**C. Stridor/Croup:**

1. Consider 1:1,000 Epinephrine nebulized per pediatric medication administration guide.

2. Consider establishing IV.

## IV. Special Considerations

**A. Pulse Oximetry:**

1. Readings can be misleading with poor perfusion (shock), cold extremities, hypothermia, anemia, or in carbon monoxide poisoning.

2. Readings may be difficult to obtain or unreliable during excessive patient moving or if nail polish is present.

3. Readings between 88% - 92% is the goal for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

4. Patients with smoke inhalation, significant burns, and potential carbon monoxide poisoning will continue to receive high flow oxygen regardless of pulse oximetry reading.

5. Patients with traumatic brain injury should receiving oxygen to maintain Sp02 of 100%.

B. Waveform capnography is useful in monitoring respiratory rates and may provide early indication of respiratory failure.

C. Intubation of the severely asthmatic patient is extremely difficult and all other measures should be exhausted first.

D. For respiratory depression with suspected narcotic overdose refer to treatment guideline 7203 Poisoning-Overdose.

E. Do not delay transport for advance airway skills if you have an adequate BLS airway.

## V. Base Orders

A. Additional Nitroglycerin requires Base Hospital consult and Physician approval.

## VI. Contraindications

A. None.
