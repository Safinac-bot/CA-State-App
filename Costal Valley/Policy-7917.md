# Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)

**Policy Number:** 7917  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** August 25, 2020  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To ensure proper understanding when treating patients with ventricular assist devices (VAD).

B. **Education:**

1. A Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) is an implanted device that is used to partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart. VADs are used as a bridge to transplant or as a destination therapy for those who are not transplant candidates.

2. All VAD patients have a VAD team member who is available 24 hours a day. The VAD team member's contact number is listed on a sticker on the patient's controller (system).

3. The patient's assessment, treatment and presentation will depend on the type of VAD. Pulse and blood pressure may or may not be palpable. If a pulse is palpable, it may not correspond with the heart rate on the monitor. The patient's underlying rhythm only requires treatment if the patient is symptomatic. Some VADs have back up hand pumps for use if the machine stops working. The VAD team member will give direction on managing the VAD machine.

4. The patient and the patient's family members receive training in their specific VAD and are good resources to prehospital personnel and can be utilized in the care of the VAD patient.

5. VAD patients are on anticoagulants and prone to bleeding.

6. All VAD patients can be defibrillated and cardioverted, if indicated.

7. Chest compressions may dislodge the internal VAD tubes from the heart, causing the patient to bleed into the thoracic and/or abdominal cavities.

## II. Scope

EMT-B, Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

**A. Procedure:**

1. When responding to a patient with a VAD, call the appropriate VAD team member as directed on the sticker on the patient's VAD controller.

2. If blood pressure and pulse are not palpable, utilize other methods of assessment on VAD patients including, but not limited to, skin signs, level of consciousness, oxygen saturation and general appearance.

3. VAD patients should be treated by the appropriate treatment guideline or protocol based on the patient's assessment and findings.

4. Attempt to locate a DNR/POLST form. Many VAD patients have made end-of-life care decisions.

5. **DO NOT perform chest compressions on VAD patients, even if unconscious and cardiopulmonary arrest is suspected.** Contact the VAD team member for further information.

6. Establish base contact if necessary.

7. Allow the family member to ride with the patient if treatment and space permit.
