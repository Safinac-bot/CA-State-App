# Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome

**Policy Number:** 7101  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** February 23, 2021  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Definition

**A. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)** has a wide variety of presentations. Symptoms may include:

1. Substernal pain.
2. Dysrhythmia.
3. Discomfort or tightness radiating to the jaw, back, and either shoulder or arm.
4. Nausea.
5. Diaphoresis.
6. Dyspnea.
7. Syncope/dizziness.
8. Other "suspicious symptoms".

**B. Myocardial Infarction (MI):** Greater than 1 mm ST segment elevation in two or more contiguous leads or meets Sgarbossa criteria.

## II. Basic Life Support

A. Provide General Medical Care.

B. Administer Aspirin 324 mg PO (approximately 4 chewable tablets).

## III. Advanced Life Support

**A. Obtain 12-Lead EKG** per procedure guideline 7103 12-Lead EKG.

1. If evidence of myocardial infarction (MI):
   a. Direct transport to the closest, most appropriate authorized STEMI Receiving Center (SRC) per CVEMSA guideline 5005 Point of Entry.
   b. Early receiving center notification of a STEMI Alert.

**B. Administer Nitroglycerin** 0.4 mg SL SBP > 110 mmHg, if inferior MI SBP > 150 mmHg.

1. May repeat every 5 minutes if symptoms persist and SBP remains > 110 mmHg.
2. Max 1.2 mg (3 doses).
3. Optional:
   a. For prolonged transports, apply ½ inch of 2% Nitroglycerin paste.
      (1) May apply an additional ½ inch if signs and symptoms persist and SBP remains > 110 mmHg.

**C. Administer Fentanyl** per treatment guideline 7305 Pain Management. Fentanyl can be administered concurrently with Nitroglycerin.

**D. Fluid Resuscitation:**

1. If SBP < 110 mmHg, administer 250 ml NS fluid bolus IV.
   a. May repeat once.
   b. Reassess vital signs after every 250 ml to ensure lung sounds remain clear.

2. If SBP <90 mmHg and cardiogenic shock suspected:
   a. Administer 500 ml NS fluid bolus IV.
      (1) Reassess vital signs after every 250 ml to ensure lung sounds remain clear.
      (2) If rales develop or worsen and hypotension persists administer push-dose Epinephrine as described below.

3. If SBP remains < 90 mmHg:
   a. Administer push-dose Epinephrine.
      (1) Mix 1 ml 1:10,000 Epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml) with 9 ml NS in a 10 ml syringe.
      (2) Administer diluted Epinephrine 1 ml every 1-5 minutes.
      (3) Titrate to maintain SBP > 90 mmHg.
   b. Consider establishing a second IV NS TKO during transport.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. For inferior myocardial infarctions with a normal blood pressure, prophylactic fluid administration is not recommended. Conversely hypotensive patients should be aggressively treated with fluid.

B. Consider establishing an IV prior to NTG administration.

C. Sgarbossa's criteria may be useful in the presence of LBBB in determining an MI.

## V. Base Orders

A. For questionable interpretations, consider Base Hospital consultation with transmission of the 12-Lead EKG.

## VI. Contraindications

A. Patients with evidence of an inferior myocardial infarction and a SBP < 150 mmHg should not receive Nitroglycerin.

B. Nitroglycerin should not be administered to patients of either gender who have taken Viagra/Levitra within 24 hours, or Cialis within 72 hours.

C. Aspirin should not be administered to patients with an active GI bleed.

## VII. Cross Reference

A. General Medical Care Policy No. 7001
B. EKG 12 Lead Policy No. 7103
C. Point of Entry Policy No. 8005
D. Pain Management Policy No. 7305
