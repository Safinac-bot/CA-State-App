## PURPOSE

a. To define suspected elder and dependent adult abuse and the required reporting procedures for prehospital care personnel.

## PRINCIPLES

a. Elder adults (age 65 or over) and dependent adults (ages 18 to 64) with mental, developmental, or physical disabilities may be vulnerable to abuse or neglect.

## POLICY

a. EMT's and EMT-P's, as health care practitioners, are mandated reporters and have a legal obligation to report known or suspected elder or dependent adult abuse under the following circumstances:

1. When the reporter has observed an incident that reasonably appears to be physical abuse

2. When the reporter has observed a physical injury where the nature of the injury, its location on the body or the repetition of the injury clearly indicates that physical abuse has occurred

3. When an elder or a dependent adult tells the reporter that he or she has experienced behavior constituting physical abuse.

b. The law encourages mandated reporters to voluntarily report known or suspected instances of other types of abuse of an elder or of a dependent adult including neglect, mental abuse, financial abuse, isolation and abandonment.

c. Reports made under this law are confidential. The identity of all persons making reports of elder or dependent abuse is also confidential. This information will be shared only between the investigating and licensing agencies, with the district attorney in a criminal prosecution resulting from the report, by court order, or when the reporter waives the right to remain anonymous.

d. When two or more persons who are required to report are present and jointly have knowledge of a known or suspected instance of abuse of an elder or dependent adult, and when there is agreement among them, the telephone report may be made by a member of the team selected by mutual agreement and a single report may be made and signed by the selected member of the reporting team. Any member who has knowledge that the member designated to report has failed to do so shall hereafter make the report.

e. Reporting is the individual responsibility of the mandated reporter. No supervisor or administrator may prohibit the filing of a required report.

f. Mandated reporters who report suspected cases of elder or dependent adult abuse in good faith, have absolute immunity, both civilly and criminally, for making a report of physical abuse of an elder or dependent adult. This includes taking of photographs of the victim and surroundings to submit with the report.

**FAILURE TO MAKE A MANDATORY REPORT OF SUSPECTED PHYSICAL ABUSE OF AN ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT IS A MISDEMEANOR.**

## REPORTING PROCEDURES

a. Reports of physical abuse are to be made immediately, or as soon as possible, by telephone.

b. When reporting abuse that allegedly occurred in a long-term care facility or Adult Day Health Care Center, contact either the local law enforcement agency or the Long-term Care Ombudsman Program:

   **Sonoma:** 707-565-5940  
   **Mendocino:** 707-463-7900

c. When the abuse is alleged to have occurred anywhere else, contact either the local law enforcement agency or Adult Protective Services at:

   **Sonoma:** 707-565-5940  
   **Mendocino:** 707-463-7900
