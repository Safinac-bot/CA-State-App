**AUTHORITY:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.172 & 1797.221

## Purpose

1. To provide a mechanism for Paramedics to monitor the transfusion of blood products during interfacility transports.

## Policy

1. **Paramedics:**

   Only those Paramedics who have successfully completed training program(s) approved by the Coastal Valleys EMS Agency Medical Director on monitoring infusion of blood products will be permitted to monitor them during interfacility transports.

2. **ALS Ambulance Providers:**

   Only those ALS Ambulance providers approved by the Coastal Valleys EMS Agency Medical Director will be permitted to provide the service of monitoring infusion of blood products during interfacility transports from hospital(s) within their service area.

3. **Patients:**

   Patients that are candidates for paramedic transport will have pre-existing blood product transfusions in peripheral lines. Coastal Valleys EMS Agency does not authorize EMS personnel to start, hang or otherwise initiate the transfusion of blood products.

## Principles

1. Patients in hemorrhagic shock may need to be transferred to a tertiary care or trauma center with blood/blood product transfusions in process as part of emergency resuscitation.

2. Blood products include packed red blood cells (PRBCs), whole blood, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, cryoprecipitate, and prothrombin complex concentrates.

3. Transfusion reactions are defined as follows:
   a. **Allergic reaction:** hives or itching only, without signs of anaphylaxis.
   b. **Anaphylaxis:** allergic reaction with angioedema, wheezing, respiratory distress, vascular instability, vomiting, diarrhea and/or shock. Rash may or may not be present.
   c. **Hemolytic transfusion reaction:** life threatening reaction that may present with fever, headache, back pain, nausea, hypotension, and pain at the transfusion site.
   d. **Volume overload:** may develop pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.

## Guidelines

1. **Before accepting responsibility for the patient:**
   a. Confirm with a nurse or physician from the sending facility, that the name on the patient's arm band and blood bank number on the blood transfusion form is the same as the name and blood bank number on the unit(s) of blood product which is (are) infusing.
   b. For uncrossmatched blood products (which will not have a patient name) confirm the uncrossmatched blood product transfusion is for the patient being transferred. A patient identification band must be present prior to transfer.

2. Document in the ePCR the physician order for the blood product(s) to be transfused, which shall include the following:
   a. Type of blood product being transfused.
   b. Rate of the transfusion
   c. Name of the transferring/ordering physician
   d. Any adverse reactions and treatments provided to the patient during transport.

3. Monitor all patients continuously during transport with a cardiac monitor and a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, documenting vital signs every 15 minutes.

4. For patients with suspected transfusion reactions (including hemolytic reactions, allergic reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and volume overload):
   a. Stop the blood product transfusion.
   b. Disconnect the IV tubing (do not flush tubing) and flush the port.
   c. Initiate care per applicable Treatment Guideline
   d. Provide the remaining blood product and tubing to the receiving hospital.

5. Document volume of blood product transfused and any suspected transfusion reaction on the ePCR. Communicate any reaction and interventions taken to the receiving facility staff.

6. All cases for which this policy is implemented will be audited by the EMS provider agency and reports sent to the Coastal Valleys EMS Agency monthly.

7. The receiving emergency department staff will be responsible for communicating any transfusion related adverse events to the sending facility.

8. During transfer of care from the sending facility to the transport paramedic, blood products shall be disconnected from infusion pumps and manual drip rate(s) set by sending medical team. Use of portable infusion pumps during transport is permissible if the paramedic has documentation of training and proof of competency in the use of the equipment on file with the ALS ambulance provider. In this case, the use of an infusion pump during transport must be included in the sending physician orders.
