## PURPOSE

a. The purpose of this policy is to serve as the utilization standard for all patient transfers between acute care facilities within the Coastal Valleys EMS Agency Region (LEMSA).

## SCOPE

a. This policy will be utilized for all patient transfers between acute care facilities. This procedure is not a substitute for required transfer agreements. Each facility shall have its own internal written transfer policy that clearly establishes administrative and professional responsibilities. Transfer agreements must be negotiated and signed with facilities that have specialized services not available at the transferring facility. [H&S Code 1317.3(a) and 1317.2(b)]

b. This policy applies to transfers originating within the LEMSA with the destination within or out of the same region.

c. EMTs and Paramedics may perform any activity identified in their scope of practice, California Administrative Code, Title 22, Division 9, which has been approved by the LEMSA. LEMSA Treatment Guidelines allow for defined treatment options. Written orders originating from non-Base Hospital Medical Direction will need to have Base Hospital Physician contact and direction.

d. Patient transfers between acute care facilities will be completed based upon the medical needs of the patient and through the cooperation of both the sending and receiving facilities in accordance with approved internal procedures and EMTALA regulation.
   1. These procedures are suggested for patient transfers from sub-acute and chronic care facilities to acute care facilities.
   2. These procedures are not necessary for transfers to sub-acute and chronic care facilities.

## TRANSFER STANDARDS

a. **Physicians** - Physicians considering patient transfer should exercise conservative judgment, always deciding in favor of patient safety. Notwithstanding the fact that the receiving facility or physicians at the receiving facility have consented to the patient transfer, the transferring physician and facility have responsibility for the patient that he or she transfers until that patient arrives at the receiving facility. The transferring physician determines what professional medical assistance should be provided for the patient during the transfer (if necessary, with the consultation of the appropriate EMS Base Hospital Physician). [H&S Code 1317.2(d)]

b. **Consent of Receiving Physician** - No transfer shall be made without the consent of the receiving physician and confirmation by the receiving hospital that the patient meets the hospital's admissions criteria relating to appropriate bed, personnel and equipment necessary to treat the patient.

c. If the patient presents to an emergency department, the patient must be examined and evaluated to determine if the patient has an emergency medical condition or is in active labor. If an emergency exists, the emergency department must provide emergency care and emergency services when appropriate facilities and qualified personnel are available.

d. The transferring physician must determine whether the patient is medically fit to transfer and when indicated, will take steps to stabilize the patient's condition.

e. **Active labor** - The term "active labor" means labor at a time at which:
   1. Delivery is imminent.
   2. There is inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another hospital prior to delivery,
   3. A transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the patient or the unborn child. [H&S Code 1317.1(c)]

f. **Immediate transfer of Critical Trauma Patients** – Patients who meet the LEMSA Trauma Triage Criteria may be immediately transferred to a Trauma Center (Refer to LEMSA Point of Entry Guidelines)
   1. Immediate transfer is at the discretion of the examining physician. It is recommended to select the most appropriate, expeditious transport modality available. It may be based on patient condition, availability of surgeon and operating room, but NOT financial factors.
   2. Those patients immediately transferred will be audited for both medical care and compliance with this procedure.

g. **Immediate transfer of Acute STEMI Patients** – Patients who meet the LEMSA STEMI criteria as outlined in the LEMSA Treatment Guidelines Policy, may be immediately transferred to a STEMI Center (Refer to LEMSA Point of Entry Guidelines)
   1. Immediate transfer is at the discretion of the examining physician. It is recommended that the most appropriate and expeditious transport modality available be selected. The mode of transportation may be based on patient condition, availability of cardiologist and cardiac cath. the facility, but NOT financial considerations.
