## PURPOSE

a. Monitoring an I.V. solution containing KCL for the treatment of potassium deficiency.

## POLICY

a. A paramedic may transport a patient who has a pre-existing I.V. solution containing KCL < 20mEq.

## PROCEDURE

a. Prehospital care providers are not allowed to start or add KCL to the I.V. solution.

b. Infusions containing KCL that have been established may be monitored only.

c. Monitor ECG rhythm to detect dysrhythmias

d. Usual dose is 10-20 mEq added to 1 liter of I.V. solution and administered at a mechanically controlled rate not to exceed 10 mEq/hour (restrictions in scope of practice limits dose to 20 mEq/L).

e. Monitor I.V. site as infiltration may cause necrosis. If patient complains of burning or irritation at the insertion site, the I.V. should be checked for patency and the infusion rate slowed.

f. If fluid bolus or I.V. medications are needed, the KCL infusion shall be discontinued and a new I.V. solution without KCL and administration device shall be used as replacement.

## ADVERSE EFFECTS

a. Observe for:
   1. **Cardiovascular:** dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest
   2. **Respiratory:** depression/arrest
   3. **Gastrointestinal:** nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
   4. **Neurological:** paresthesia of extremities, muscular paralysis, confusion.
   5. **Other:** hyperkalemia, venous thrombosis
