b. Trauma Bypass shall not be contingent upon ED saturation or non-functioning CT scanner, except for isolated traumatic head injuries.

## BYPASS PROCEDURE

d. **STEMI Bypass:** Unable to receive STEMI patients.

e. **Stroke Bypass:** Unable to receive stroke patients due to lack of CT scan capability.

## AMBULANCE DIRECTION FOR TRAUMA PATIENTS DURING BYPASS EVENT

a. Ambulance providers shall call their assigned base hospital for direction during any Trauma Center bypass event and consider the following:
   1) Transportation to the next closest Trauma Center by either ground or air. Ground ambulance providers should consider utilization of an EMS aircraft and/or transportation to an off-scene landing zone.
   2) Patients may be transported to the nearest Emergency Department if timely access to an alternative Trauma Center is not possible.

## OFF BYPASS

a. To re-establish normal ambulance traffic and acceptance of all patients, the supervisor or designee shall:

## EMS AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS

a. Hospitals will monitor and review all bypass incidents and will submit reports to the EMS Agency when requested.

## BYPASS ADDENDUM

b. Base hospitals and/or the EMS Agency may check with a hospital on bypass at any time to determine the prognosis for continuance of bypass. The EMS Agency may at any time send EMS Agency staff to the facility on bypass to verify the reasons given for bypass.

c. Whenever a Trauma Center in the EMS system is on bypass, base hospitals shall keep an update of surrounding Trauma Center availability for their service area and applicable adjacent areas.

## INTERFACILITY TRAUMA TRANSFER – SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR LEVEL II TRAUMA CENTER

a. The trauma center shall not redirect interfacility trauma patients from the Coastal Valleys EMS Region, including Lake County when:
   1) Patients are candidates for immediate surgical/operative intervention and when such services are available, and the trauma center is not on Trauma Bypass regardless of bed availability.

   1) Patients requiring surgical specialty care services when such services are not available, e.g., cardiothoracic.

c. In the event a sending facility is redirected by the Trauma Center, the sending facility shall contact the nearest Level I Trauma Center for consultation and direction.

## EMS AGENCY RIGHT TO DENY BYPASS

a. The EMS Agency reserves the right to deny bypass approval based on overriding community need, impending EMS system need or determination that bypass criteria are unmet. If multiple hospitals meet bypass criteria at the same time, hospitals will be expected to treat patients to the best of their ability and there will be no EMS Agency approved bypass for any facility.
