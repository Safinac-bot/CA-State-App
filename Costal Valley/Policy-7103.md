## I. Definition

A. Any patient with suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).

B. STEMI: Greater than 1 mm of ST segment elevation in two or more contiguous leads.

C. Post cardiac arrest.

## II. Basic Life Support

A. None.

## III. Advance Life Support

**A. Attach EKG leads to the patient** (limb leads to the upper arms, legs, and six chest leads) to perform EKG.

1. V1: Right 4th intercostal space.
2. V2: Left 4th intercostal space.
3. V3: Halfway between V2 and V4.
4. V4: Left 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line.
5. V5: Horizontal to V4, anterior axillary line.
6. V6: Horizontal to V5, mid-axillary line.
7. V4R: Right 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line.

**B. If 12 lead indicates an acute STEMI:**

1. Transport to an approved STEMI receiving center according to CVEMSA Policy 8005 Point of entry.

2. Early receiving facility notification of a STEMI Alert.

3. Transmit EKG to the receiving facility.
   a. If unable to transmit and with patient permission, a cell phone may be used to send an image of the 12-Lead to the receiving facility.

4. If evidence of an Inferior Myocardial Infarction, consider conducting a right sided 12-Lead to rule out a Right Ventricular Infarction (RVI). Patients with an inferior MI, who have a SBP < 150 mmHg should not receive Nitroglycerin.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. Sgarbossa's criteria may be useful in the presence of LBBB in determining an MI.

## V. Base Orders

A. None.

## VI. Contraindications

A. None.

## VII. Cross References
