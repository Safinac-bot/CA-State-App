## III. Advanced Life Support

### Adult

**A. If BG <80 mg/dL and patient has an altered mental status and unable to self-administer oral glucose:**

1. Administer Dextrose 25 G IV infusion (D10) or IVP (D50). Titrate to achieve normal mental status. D10 is preferred over D50.
   a. May repeat once if BG remains below 60 mg/dL and symptoms persist.

2. If unable to establish IV, administer Glucagon 1 mg IM.
   a. Do not repeat.

**B. If patient is hyperglycemic (BG > 400 mg/dL) and symptomatic (tachypnea, altered mental status, or ETCO2 <25 mmHg):**

1. Administer NS fluid bolus 10 ml/kg IV.
   a. May repeat as indicated.
   b. Max total volume 1 L.
   c. Reassess vital signs every 250 ml to ensure lung sounds remain clear.

**C. If seizures occur refer to treatment guideline 7402 Seizures.**

### Pediatric (less than 14 years of age)

**A. If BG <80 mg/dL and patient has an altered mental status and unable to self-administer oral glucose:**

2. May repeat once if BG remains below 60 mg/dL and symptoms persist.

3. If unable to establish IV, administer Glucagon per pediatric medication administration guide.
   a. Do not repeat.

C. BG may require 15 minutes or more to show improvements after Glucagon administration.

D. Patients who present with signs of DKA (tachypnea, ETCO2 less than 25 mmHg, or altered mental status) may require more than 1 L NS for prolonged transports.

## V. Base Orders

A. Base Hospital consultation is advised if administering greater than 1 L NS.

## VI. Contraindications

A. NS fluid bolus is contraindicated in patients with a history of CHF or renal failure.

## VII. Cross Reference
