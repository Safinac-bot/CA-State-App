## ADULT & PEDIATRIC - BLS

### I. CAUSES FOR DETERMINATION OF DEATH

A. Any adult patient (15yrs old and >) who remains pulseless, apneic and "No Shock Advised" from AED after completing 20 minutes of CAM per Treatment Guideline 8016 Cardiac Arrest Management prior to ALS arrival.

B. Decapitation

C. Incineration

D. Rigor Mortis

E. Livor Mortis (Lividity)

F. Decomposition

G. Pulseless and apneic blunt traumatic arrest – ADULT only

H. Pulseless and apneic penetrating traumatic arrest and ALS arrival is greater than 10 minutes– ADULT only.

I. Total separation of vital organs from body, or total destruction of organs with absence of life signs

J. Absence of life signs or severely compromised vital signs when there are multiple victims, and resuscitation would hinder care of more viable patients.

K. Submersion greater than or equal to one hour: physical examination of body with accurate and reliable history of submersion time.

L. **Valid DNR**
   1) Upon presentation of a valid POLST form, DNR or Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, (DPAHC must request DNR or similar status).
      a) Do not initiate CPR.
      b) Terminate CPR if already in progress.
      c) If there is any doubt whether to start or withhold CPR, first responders should start CPR and await the arrival of an advanced life support provider.
      d) Notify appropriate law enforcement agency and/or coroner. A completed PCR must be left at the scene or faxed within 2 hours to the coroner.
      e) Ensure scene security until released by law enforcement.
      f) Base Hospital contact is not necessary.
      g) Resuscitation may be withheld at family request if there is unanimous agreement between all family members on scene. In such a case the EMT or Paramedic may choose to consult with the Base Hospital MD, however the consultation is optional. If there is any doubt or dissension among family or rescuers as to the appropriateness of the decision to withhold resuscitation, resuscitative efforts should continue as per protocol(s).

**Consideration:** Strong family insistence on resuscitation may lead to base contact in cases where it otherwise would not be indicated.

## ALS

### I. TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION MEDICAL – ADULT

A. Any patient who remains pulseless, apneic, and asystolic after completing appropriate ACLS intervention per protocol for a minimum of 20 minutes.

B. Patients who remain pulseless and apneic with PEA, may have the resuscitation terminated after 20 minutes if an ETCO2 level is less than 10.

C. Ongoing V-Fib should be worked via CAM for at least 30 minutes requires base contact.

### II. TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION TRAUMA – ADULT

A. Pulseless and apneic blunt force traumatic arrest.

B. Penetrating, or profound multi-system traumatic arrest that are:
   1. Pulseless and Apneic, and,
   2. Asystole or PEA less than 40 BPM in two (2) leads for 60 seconds
      a. If the patient presents with a penetrating traumatic arrest and a PEA >40, immediate transport should be initiated to the nearest trauma center. If the nearest trauma center is greater than 30 minutes, expedite transport to the closest emergency department.

### III. TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION DURING TRANSPORT- ADULT

A. If the patient is already enroute to the hospital, such a decision results in the immediate termination of Code 3 transport.

B. Transport shall continue to the closest receiving facility.

C. All disposable ALS devices shall remain in place.

### IV. PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS

A. Pediatric traumatic arrests are to be transported expediently to the appropriate facility.

B. Pediatric arrests that are resuscitated in the field have a much higher rate of survival to discharge neurologically intact. At minimum, pediatric arrests should be resuscitated at scene for 10 to 30 minutes with a minimum of three (3) rounds of epinephrine. Refer to Treatment Guideline 76011 Unexpected Infant/Child Death to determine whether to perform resuscitation measures.

## BASE HOSPITAL ORDERS ONLY

I. Patients who remain pulseless and apneic with PEA, and an ETCO2 greater than 10, Base Hospital contact is necessary before the termination of resuscitation.

II. Patients who remain pulseless and apneic with ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia and have received a minimum of 30 minutes of continuous resuscitation, cannot have further efforts terminated without Base Hospital contact.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

### I. PROCEDURE FOR AN ARREST IN A PUBLIC FORUM

A. Victims of an arrest in a public forum should have resuscitation begun immediately, and shall be moved to a private working space or placed in the ambulance when appropriate, out of the public view.

B. **Exceptions include:**
   1) Suspected crime scene
   2) Decapitation
   3) Incineration

C. Should determination of death be made during transport, an immediate termination of Code 3 transport shall occur. The patient will then be transported to the appropriate facility, either a hospital, or an authorized on-site medical facility. All other determination of death procedures shall apply.

### II. DEFINITIONS

A. **Absence of life signs** is determined by the physical examination of the patient. Palpating the carotid pulse for a minimum of 60 seconds. Assessing the absence or respirations for a minimum of 60 seconds.

B. **Asystole** is determined by the use of a cardiac monitor, attaching the leads, and documenting asystole in 2 leads for a minimum of 60 seconds.

C. **Rigor Mortis** – the stiffness seen in corpses. Rigor mortis begins with the muscles of mastication and progresses from the head down, affecting the legs last. It generally manifests within 1-6 hours.

D. **Livor Mortis (Lividity)** – cutaneous dark spots on dependent portions of a corpse. Generally manifests within 30 minutes to 2 hours.

E. **DNR** – Do Not Resuscitate.

F. **POLST** – Physician Order for Life Sustaining Treatment (copies of the original are acceptable).

### III. BLS DETERMINATION OF DEATH

A. If BLS terminates resuscitation prior to ALS arrival, ALS reassessment is not required.
