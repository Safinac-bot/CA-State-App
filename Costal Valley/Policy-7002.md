## III. Advanced Life Support

### Adult

**A. Mild Sedation:**
1. Administer Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM.
   a. Diphenhydramine 25 mg – 50 mg may be administered IV.
   b. Max dose 50 mg.

**B. Moderate/Significant Sedation:**
1. Administer Midazolam 2 mg slow IVP.
   a. Monitor EtCO2.
   b. Titrate to desired degree of sedation and maintain SBP > 90 mmHg.
   c. May repeat 1-2 mg every 3 minutes.
   d. If unable to establish IV, administer 2 mg – 5 mg IM.
      (1) May repeat initial IM dose every 10 – 15 minutes.
   e. Max total dose 10 mg.
      (1) Patients with concomitant narcotic administration should not exceed a max dose of 0.05 mg/kg.
      (2) For long transport, max dose may be exceeded for sedation maintenance.
          (a) Administer 1 mg IV every 15 minutes.
          (b) Additional doses greater than max dose requires base orders.

2. If patient SBP < 90 mmHg administer Fentanyl 50 mcg – 100 mcg IV/IM instead of Midazolam.

### Pediatric (less than 14 years of age)

**A. Mild Sedation:**
1. Administer Diphenhydramine per pediatric medication administration guide.
   a. Do not repeat.

**B. Moderate/Significant Sedation:**
1. Administer Midazolam per pediatric medication administration guide.
   a. Titrate to desired degree of sedation and maintain age appropriate SBP.
   b. May repeat initial dose one time after 15 minutes.
   c. If transport time is greater than 30 minutes, may repeat once as needed.
   d. Any additional doses require base orders. 0.5 mg -1 mg

2. If patient is hypotensive, administer Fentanyl per the pediatric medication administration guide instead of Midazolam.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. Sedation is considered a chemical restraint when used to treat behavioral disturbance or endangerment. Detailed documentation is required when using sedation for this purpose.

B. Pain management may be indicated in the presence of proposed sedation. Pain medication may be administered at a reduced dose, typically ½ the normal dose.

C. Patients over 65 years of age should not exceed a max dose of Midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV/IM.

D. Concomitant narcotic administration.

E. Concomitant use of Fentanyl and Midazolam is discouraged. The combination can cause respiratory depression and hypotension.

## V. Base Orders

A. For transport times greater than 30 minutes, may repeat once as needed. Any additional doses require base orders.

## VI. Contraindications

**A. Absolute:**
1. Sensitivity to the medication to be administered.
2. Repeat dosing for pediatric patients with concomitant narcotic administration.

**B. Relative:** Paramedic judgement is necessary when evaluating the need for sedation in these circumstances.
1. Nausea/Vomiting.
2. Depressed mentation.
3. Hypotension.
4. Suspected drug/alcohol intoxication.
5. Head Injury.
6. Multiple systems traumas.

## VII. Cross Reference
