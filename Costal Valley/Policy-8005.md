A Receiving Hospital must have a physician on duty, be always equipped to provide prompt care for any patient presenting with urgent medical problems.

## DESTINATION FOR MAJOR TRAUMA PATIENTS

a. Major trauma patients (i.e. those patients meeting trauma triage criteria) shall be transported as follows:
   1. Within 60 minutes air transport time from a trauma center – patient shall be transported to the closest APPROPRIATE trauma center.
   2. Greater than 60 minutes air transport time from a trauma center – contact base hospital for destination

b. Notwithstanding the above, patients with the following conditions shall be transported to the closest emergency department (including a standby ED):
   1. Unstable or unmanageable airway
   2. Rapidly deteriorating vital signs
   3. Base station physician order

## DESTINATION FOR PEDIATRIC TRAUMA PATIENTS

a. Pediatric patients (less than 15 years of age) with major trauma may be transported by EMS helicopter to an approved pediatric trauma center with the following exceptions:
   1. Greater than 60 minutes transport time unless otherwise authorized by base hospital
   2. Pediatric patients meeting trauma triage criteria and originating from within the core area of Santa Rosa will be transported by ground ambulance to the closest appropriate Trauma Center.

b. Notwithstanding the above, patients with the following conditions shall be transported to the closest emergency department (including a standby ED):
   1. Pulseless, apneic following trauma
   2. Unstable or unmanageable airway
   3. Rapidly deteriorating vital signs
   4. Base station physician order

## DESTINATION FOR ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION PATIENTS (STEMI)

a. Critical cardiac patients (i.e. those with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction on Prehospital 12 Lead ECG) shall be transported as follows:
   1. Within 30 minutes transport time from a STEMI Receiving Center – patients shall be transported to the closest appropriate STEMI Receiving Center
   2. Greater than 30 minutes transport time from a STEMI Receiving Center – patients shall be transported to the closest hospital with an emergency department

## DESTINATION FOR BURN PATIENTS VIA EMS AIRCRAFT

a. Patients with significant burns may be transported directly by EMS aircraft from the field to a regional burn center (with approved helipad) within the guidelines of #4007 EMS Aircraft Policy.

b. Patients with the following anatomical criteria are candidates for transport directly by air to the closest regional burn center:
   1. Full thickness burns greater than 5% burn surface area (BSA)
   2. Partial thickness burns greater than 10% BSA if under age 10 or over 50
   3. Partial thickness over 20% - any age
   4. Partial or full thickness burns to the face, eyes, ears, hands, feet, perineum, genitalia, or major joints
   5. Significant electrical and caustic chemical agent burns
   6. Circumferential burns to an extremity or trunk
   7. Inhalation injury with evidence of significant burns
   8. Burns in high-risk patients, including those with significant underlying medical conditions

c. Base contact should be made in cases where the burns are of uncertain depth or severity or in any other case where the Prehospital personnel require assistance deciding which the most appropriate receiving facility is.

d. EMS Air crews will be responsible for notifying the regional burn center with their ETA and field assessment.

e. **Exceptions:**
   1. Burn patients meeting trauma triage criteria will be transported to the nearest trauma receiving facility. Patients with any of the following will be transported to the nearest receiving facility:
      a) Unmanageable airway
      b) Deteriorating vital signs
      c) Pulseless and apneic

## DESTINATION FOR PATIENTS WITH SUSPECTED ACUTE CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (CVA)

a. Rapidly transport to the patient's preferred hospital as long as the estimated transport time does not increase travel time by more than ten (10) minutes compared to the closest receiving hospital. If the closest receiving hospital does not have a functioning CT scanner and the patient has an abnormal BEFAST and the onset of symptoms to arrival at receiving hospital is expected to be 18 hours or less the patient may be transported to the next closest receiving hospital with an operational CT scanner.

b. Patients with unstable airways, uncontrolled bleeding, or in cardiac arrest should be transported to the nearest Emergency Department regardless of CT status.
