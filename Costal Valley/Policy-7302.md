**Policy Number:** 7302  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** May 25, 2021  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Definition

A. Sepsis is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening condition due to systemic infection. Sepsis must be recognized early and treated aggressively to prevent progression to shock and death. The purpose of a Sepsis Alert is to provide pre-arrival Emergency Department notification in order to facilitate rapid assessment and treatment of a suspected severe sepsis patient.

B. **Sepsis Criteria:**

Initiate a Sepsis Alert for adult patients meeting the following 3 criteria:

### Two or More SIRS Criteria:
1. Temperature > 100.4° F (38° C) or < 96.8° F (36° C).
2. Respiratory Rate > 20 breaths/min.
3. Heart Rate > 90 beats/min.

### EtCO2 < 25 mmHg

## II. Basic Life Support

A. Provide General Medical Care.

## III. Advanced Life Support

A. Administer NS fluid bolus 250 ml IV to maintain adequate perfusion:
1. May repeat to a max of 2 L.
   a. Patients on renal dialysis should receive a max of 1 L.

B. Early receiving facility notification of a Sepsis Alert.

C. If unable to maintain SBP > 90 mmHg after NS fluid bolus of 2L:
1. Prepare push-dose Epinephrine:
   a. Mix 1 ml of 1:10,000 Epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml) with 9 ml NS in a 10 ml syringe.
   b. Administer push-dose Epinephrine 1 ml IV every 1 – 4 minutes.
   c. Titrate to maintain a SBP > 90 mmHg.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. An article in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine states that using the above protocol demonstrated it was very predictive of sepsis and severe sepsis. A pre-hospital screening tool utilizing end-tidal carbon dioxide predicts sepsis and severe sepsis. The most common protocol infraction was activating a sepsis alert with an EtCO2 > 25 mmHg. Base consultation for an ill-appearing patient not meeting Sepsis Alert criteria is appropriate; this may be especially true for an EtCO2 between 26 mmHg to 30 mmHg.

B. EtCO2 < 25 mmHg correlates to serum lactate levels > 4.

## V. Base Orders

A. None.

## VI. Contraindications

A. None.

## VII. Cross Reference
