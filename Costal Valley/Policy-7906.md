1. Ketorolac is a first generation non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been approved for use by the FDA since 1989. Since its approval, Ketorolac has been used throughout the world for pain control both within hospitals, and more recently, prehospital. For healthy adult patients, Ketorolac has been a successful analgesic with a small side effect profile. Specifically, for biliary and renal colic. Studies have shown great success with this NSAID's use over other interventions. Ketorolac as a pain medication avoids risks of life-threatening respiratory depression and hypotension that is seen with the IV opiate medications commonly used in EMS.
