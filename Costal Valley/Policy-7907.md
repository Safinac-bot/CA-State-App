# Administration of Tranexamic Acid

**Policy Number:** 7907  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** February 25, 2020  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To provide guidance on the administration of Tranexamic Acid for blunt or penetrating major trauma and postpartum hemorrhage.

B. **Indications:** Blunt or penetrating major Trauma and significant postpartum hemorrhage.

C. **Criteria for Traumatic Hemorrhagic shock:**

1. Within 3 hours of injury, TXA should be considered for all blunt or penetrating trauma patients with signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic shock for age greater than 15 years or more than 45 KG, and that meet ANY ONE of the following inclusion criteria:
   a. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg at any time during patient encounter
   b. Bleeding not controlled by direct pressure, hemostatic agents, or tourniquet application.

D. **Criteria for postpartum hemorrhage:**

a. Within 3 hours of vaginal delivery, TXA should be considered for vaginal bleeding greater than 500 cc. This should follow vigorous fundal massage and IV fluids.

b. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg is not a requirement for administration for postpartum hemorrhage.

E. **Education:**

1. Tranexamic Acid (TXA) is a lysine analogue that works to inhibit the formation of plasmin, which is a molecule responsible for clot degradation. It therefore stabilizes clots and slows down bleeding. It has recently been shown in multiple studies to reduce mortality in trauma patients meeting specific physiologic criteria or who have signs of massive trauma.

## II. Scope

Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

None.

## IV. Advance Life Support

A. Administer Tranexemic Acid (TXA) per treatment guideline 7802 Major Trauma.

1. 1 gram in 100 ml NS IV infusion over 10 minutes.
   a. Do not administer IV Push. This will cause hypotension.

2. Place appropriate wrist band on the patient identifying that TXA was administered.

## V. Special Considerations

None.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

A. > 3 hours post injury or birth.

B. Isolated extremity amputation when bleeding has been controlled and if there is a strong expectation of re-implantation

C. Isolated spinal shock.

D. Traumatic arrest with >5 minutes of CPR without ROSC.

E. Drowning or hanging victims.

F. < 15 years of age and weighing < 45 kg.

G. Active thromboembolic event (within 24 hours); i.e. CVA, MI, PE, DVT.

H. Hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction to TXA.

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. Time of injury/birth.

B. Time of administration.
