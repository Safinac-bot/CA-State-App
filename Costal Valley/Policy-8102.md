## PURPOSE

a. To provide a mechanism for Paramedics to be permitted to monitor infusions of nitroglycerin and heparin during inter-facility transfers.

## POLICY

a. **Paramedics**
   1. Only those Paramedics who have successfully completed training program(s) approved by the Coastal Valleys EMS Agency Medical Director on nitroglycerin and heparin infusions will be permitted to monitor them during inter-facility transports.

b. **ALS Ambulance Providers**
   1. Only those ALS Ambulance providers approved by the Coastal Valleys EMS Agency Medical Director will be permitted to provide the service of monitoring nitroglycerin and/or heparin infusions during interfacility transports from approved hospital(s) within their service area.

c. **Patients**
   1. Patients that are candidates for paramedic transport will have pre-existing heparin and/or nitroglycerin drips in peripheral lines. Pre-hospital personnel will not initiate heparin and nitroglycerin drips.

## PROCEDURE

a. The paramedic shall receive the transferring orders from the transferring physician prior to leaving the sending hospital, including a telephone number where the transferring physician can be reached during the patient transport. The written order must include the type of solution, dosage and rate of infusion for the IV fluids.

b. If medication administration is interrupted (infiltration, accidental disconnection, malfunctioning pump, etc.), the Paramedic may restart the line as delineated in the transfer orders.

c. All medication drips will be in the form of an IV piggyback monitored by a mechanical pump familiar to the Paramedic. In cases of pump malfunction that cannot be corrected, the medication drip will be discontinued and the transferring hospital and base hospital will be notified.

### d. NITROGLYCERIN DRIPS

1. Paramedics are allowed to transport patients on nitroglycerin drips within the following parameters:
   a) Infusion fluid will be D5W. Medication concentration will be either 25 mg/250mL or 50 mg/250mL.
   b) Regulation of the drip rate will be within parameters as defined by the transferring physician, but in no case will changes be in greater than 5 mcg/minute increments every 10 minutes.
   c) In cases of severe hypotension, the medication drip will be discontinued and the transferring hospital and base hospital will be notified.
   d) **ABSOLUTE DRIP RATES WILL NOT EXCEED 50 mcg/minute.**
   e) Vital signs will be monitored and documented every 10 minutes.

### e. HEPARIN DRIPS

1. Paramedics are allowed to transport patients on heparin drips within the following parameters:
   a) Infusion fluid will be D5W or NS. Medication concentration will be 100U/mL of IV fluid (25,000U/250mL).
   b) Drip rates will remain constant during transport. No regulation of the rate will be performed except to turn off the infusion completely.
   c) **DRIP RATES WILL NOT EXCEED 1600 U/HOUR.**
   d) Vital signs will be monitored and documented every 10 minutes.

## QI

a. All calls will be audited by the provider agency and by the transferring and receiving hospitals. Audits will assess compliance with physician orders and regional protocols, including base hospital contact in emergency situations. Reports will be sent to the EMS agency as requested.
