# Acute Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke)

**Policy Number:** 7401  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** August 24, 2021  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Definition

A. Sudden onset weakness, paralysis, confusion, speech disturbances. May be associated with a headache.

B. **Stroke Alert Criteria:**

### BEFAST Assessment

| Component | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Balance** | Does the person have sudden onset loss of balance, difficulty ambulating, and/or lack of coordination? |
| **Eyes** | Has the person had a sudden change of vision in one or both eyes? |
| **Facial Droop** | Does the person's face appear uneven? |
| **Arm Weakness** | Ask patient to close both eyes and extended both arms out straight, palms up, for 10 seconds. If both arms move the same or do not move, the test is normal. If one arm drifts downwards, the test is abnormal. Patients with arm weakness will tend to pronate (turn palms sideways or down). |
| **Speech Abnormalities** | Have the patient say, "The sky is blue today". If the patient speaks without slurring, the test is normal. If the patient slurs words or is unable to speak, the test is abnormal. |
| **Time** | When did the symptoms first begin and/or when was the patient last seen normal. Do not delay transport if the interval from the onset of symptoms to arrival at receiving facility is expected to be 18 hours or less. |

**If any one of these tests is abnormal and is a new finding, the Stroke Scale is abnormal and may indicate an acute stroke. Consult family if abnormalities are different from baseline.**

## II. Basic Life Support

A. Provide General Medical Care.

B. Perform a BEFAST assessment.

C. Early receiving facility notification of a Stroke Alert if indicated.

D. Check blood glucose:
1. If hypo/hyperglycemia etiology is suspected, refer to treatment guideline 7306 Hypo/Hyperglycemia.

## III. Advanced Life Support

A. Establish IV.

B. Obtain 12 lead EKG per procedure guideline 7103 12 Lead EKG.

C. If seizures occur refer to treatment guideline 7402 Seizures.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. If onset of symptoms are within 18 hours, transport to receiving facility is a priority to rapidly identify large vessel occlusions.

B. If exact time of onset of symptoms is unclear, use last time patient known to be at baseline.

C. Contact receiving facility as early as possible.

D. If possible, bring a family member or other on-scene historian to the receiving facility.

E. Rapid identification and transport of suspected stroke patients, along with a detailed history will help expedite patient evaluation at the receiving facility and make the widest range of possible treatment options available.
