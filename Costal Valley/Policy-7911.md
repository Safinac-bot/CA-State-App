# Endotracheal Intubation

**Policy Number:** 7911  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** May 19, 2020  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To provide guidelines on the indications and procedure of endotracheal intubation.

B. **Indications:**
1. Inability to adequately ventilate a patient with a Bag Valve Mask (BVM) and basic airway adjunct
2. An unconscious patient without a gag reflex who is apneic or is demonstrating inadequate respiratory effort.

## II. Scope

Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

None

## IV. Advance Life Support

A. Check equipment and position the patient.
1. If trauma, have assistant hold in-line spinal immobilization in neutral position.
2. If no trauma, place in sniffing position (best obtained with face parallel to the ceiling, and the auditory canals in the same plane as the sternal notch).

B. Hyper-oxygenate with 100% O2 with BVM for 1-3 minutes. Avoid hyperventilation and suction airway if needed.

C. Select the proper ETT and insert stylet (straight with 30 degree angle at the balloon â€“ the "hockey stick" configuration).

D. ETTI (bougie) is an appropriate, optional method.

E. Perform laryngoscopy.
1. Place laryngoscope in mouth and carefully follow the tongue until the epiglottis is visualized at the base of the tongue. With visualization of the epiglottis, the success is highly likely. To improve laryngeal view, use the right hand to manipulate the thyroid cartilage and then have an assistant maintain that position as you proceed.
2. Place the ETT. Confirm tracheal location and appropriate depth and secure tube. Typically observe the balloon pass 2-3cm beyond the cords and the tube is generally positioned at 22cm at the teeth.
3. Confirm and document tracheal location by:
   a. ETCO2, preferably with waveform capnography
   b. Presence and symmetry of breath sounds
   c. Increasing O2 saturation.
   d. Other means as needed

F. Ventilate with BVM. Assess adequacy of ventilations.

G. During transport continually reassess ventilation, oxygenation and tube position with continuous waveform capnography and O2 sat.

## V. Special Considerations

A. Ventilate at age appropriate rates. Do not hyperventilate. Aim for O2 sat of 88-92% in COPD patients, 94-98% in all others.

B. Post ROSC patients should be ventilated at 8-10 breaths per minute with low tidal volumes.

C. If the intubated patient deteriorates, think "DOPE".
1. Dislodgement.
2. Obstruction.
3. Pneumothorax.
4. Equipment failure (no oxygen).

D. Reconfirm and document correct tube position, preferably with waveform capnography, after moving the patient and before disconnecting from monitor in the ED.

E. Unsuccessful intubation does not equal failed airway management. Many patients cannot be intubated. Many patients cannot be intubated without paralytics. Abandon further attempts at intubation and use a supraglottic airway or BVM ventilations if 2 attempts at intubation are unsuccessful.

F. Video laryngoscopy is an optional airway device.

G. Accredited flight paramedics are permitted to perform oral endotracheal intubation on all ages.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

A. A patient who can be measured with a length based resuscitation tape.

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. Number of intubation attempts.

B. Successful or unsuccessful attempts.

C. Correct tube position.

D. Reassessment of placement every 2-3 minutes.

E. EtCO2 Wave form if available.

F. SPO2 before and after placement.
