B. **Policy:** Paramedics are empowered by law to obtain blood samples by request of appropriate law enforcement agency. If the patient is in the care of the paramedic the blood collection must not interfere with medical care. It will be the provider agency's right to determine if their personnel shall participate in this policy.

**A. Procedure:**

1. A law enforcement representative must requests the blood sample be collected and must be present to witness.

2. There must be the appropriate collection equipment immediately available.

3. The paramedic will obtain the collection sample only if the following conditions are met:

4. The paramedic provider agency has a written agreement with the local law enforcement agency to provide blood collection services;

5. The paramedic is capable of obtaining the collection sample;

6. If the individual that the blood sample is being drawn from is a patient, treatment may not be delayed, compromised, or interfered with as a result of the blood collection;

7. The paramedic ensures appropriate chain of custody of the blood sample.

8. If the subject is physically combative and requires the need to be physically restrained, the draw will be completed at the paramedics' discretion. Their decision will be based on the safety of the subject, those restraining the subject, and the safety of the paramedic completing the blood draw. This applies to both consensual and forced draws that are being requested with an order from the court.

9. No more than 3 attempts should be made unless circumstances dictate the need for additional attempts.

## V. Special Considerations
