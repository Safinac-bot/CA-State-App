## I. Definition

A. Pain in the presence of normal mentation and extrication, movement, or transportation is required which will cause considerable pain to the patient and there are no known contraindications to administering analgesia.

## II. Basic Life Support

A. Provide General Medical Care.

B. Place patient in position of comfort without significant manipulation of suspected fractures.

C. Apply cold compress as indicated.

## III. Advanced Life Support

### Adult

**A. Administer Fentanyl 50 mcg – 100 mcg slow IVP (over one minute).**

1. May repeat initial dose every 5 minutes if pain persists.
2. Max dose 300 mcg.
3. Fentanyl may also be administered 1.5 mcg/kg IN.
   a. May repeat in 15 minutes
4. If unable to establish IV, administer Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IM.
   a. May repeat in 30 minutes at ½ the initial dose.
   b. Max single dose 100 mcg with a max total dose 200 mcg.
5. For transport times more than one-hour, max total dose 300 mcg regardless of route.

**B. Administer Acetaminophen 1000 mg in 100 ml NS over 15 minutes per procedure guideline 7921 Acetaminophen Administration.**

1. Do not repeat.

**C. Administer Ketorolac 15 mg IV per procedure guideline 7906 Ketorolac Administration for mild to moderate pain.**

1. If unable to establish IV, administer Ketorolac 30 mg IM.
2. Do not repeat.

**D. Administer Lidocaine 2% when establishing IO access on a conscious patient.**

1. Immediately following placement of the IO needle, administer 0.5 mg/kg 2% Lidocaine (not to exceed 50 mg) slowly through the IO site. Wait approximately 30–60 seconds before flushing with normal saline.

2. In the event a patient regains consciousness and complains of severe pain secondary to the IO insertion, temporarily stop infusing the fluids, and administer 0.5 mg/kg 2% Lidocaine (not to exceed 50 mg) slowly through the IO site. Wait approximately 30–60 seconds before continuing fluid administration.

### Pediatric (less than 14 years of age)

**A. Administer Fentanyl per the pediatric medication administration guide.**

1. May repeat once.

**B. Administer Ketorolac per pediatric medication administration guide.**

1. Do not repeat.
2. Max dose 15 mg.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. Monitor patient vitals carefully and ensure patent airway.

B. Use caution in frail and elderly patients.

C. Consider using EtCO2 monitoring with repeated doses.

D. IM administration of Ketorolac may have a variable absorption rate.

E. It is likely that 80% or more of our patients in Coastal Valleys will receive Fentanyl as the primary pain medication. It is effective, easy to administer and titrate, and inexpensive. In children, it can be effectively used IN, thus avoiding IV starts or injections.

F. IN administration of Fentanyl is a useful method in treating pain for adults and children.

G. Ketorolac will not affect hemodynamics, respiratory function, or alertness. Except in kidney stone patients, it is not as effective as Fentanyl. It is therefore most helpful in mild to moderate pain situations, or when you want to avoid narcotic analgesia.

H. Patients with known or suspected liver failure should not receive Acetaminophen and only one dose of Fentanyl.

## V. Base Orders

A. If pain persist, contact Base Hospital for any repeat doses exceeding max dose.

## VI. Contraindications

A. Sensitivity to the medication.

B. Ketorolac is contraindicated in major trauma patients and abdominal pain.

## VII. Cross Reference

A. General Medical Care Policy No. 7001
B. Acetaminophen Administration Policy No. 7921
C. Ketorolac Administration Policy No. 7906
D. Burns Policy No. 7801
E. Major Trauma Policy No. 7802
