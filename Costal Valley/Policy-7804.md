# Crush Syndrome

**Policy Number:** 7804  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** November 23, 2021  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Definition

A. Crush syndrome is a systemic illness characterized by dysrhythmias and shock.

B. Crush syndrome can develop when an individual is entrapped with extensive tissue injury. Patients are at risk for crush syndrome if they have all of the following:
1. Circumferential compression causing crush injury.
2. Involvement of a large muscle group (lower extremity including the thigh(s), and/or pelvic girdle, or upper extremity including the pectoral girdle).
3. Entrapment for at least 1 hour.

C. The risk of crush syndrome increases with the amount of muscle involved and the duration of the entrapment.

D. Hyperkalemia: EKG findings include peaked T-waves in multiple leads, absent p-waves, and/or widened QRS-complex).

## II. Basic Life Support

A. For crush injury that does not meet the definition of crush syndrome, release compression and extricate patient.

B. Provide General Medical Care.

C. Consider spinal precautions per procedure guideline 7803 Spinal Motion Restriction.

D. Provide passive warming measures if indicated.

E. Consider the use of a tourniquet prior to extrication to prevent toxins from entering the patient or for hemorrhage control per treatment guideline 7806 Uncontrolled Hemorrhage/Amputation.

## III. Advanced Life Support

A. Provide pain management per treatment guideline 7305 Severe Pain.

B. If unable to establish vascular access while entrapped, consider tourniquet placement per treatment guideline 7806 Uncontrolled Hemorrhage/Amputation prior to extrication.

C. Assess for signs of hyperkalemia. If evidence of hyperkalemia, refer to treatment guideline 7303 Hyperkalemia.

### Adult

**A. For suspected crush syndrome:**

1. Administer NS fluid bolus 1 L rapid IV infusion prior to release of compressive force.
   a. May repeat once.
   b. Max total volume 2 L.
   c. Reassess vital signs after every 250 ml to ensure lung sounds remain clear.

### Pediatric (less than 15 years of age)

**A. For suspected crush syndrome:**

1. Administer NS fluid bolus 20 ml/kg rapid IV infusion prior to release of compressive force.
   a. May repeat once.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. First responders need to balance the need for extrication with the timing of interventions. Ideally normal saline and medications would be administered prior to the release of the compressive force, but extrication should not be unreasonably delayed for ALS care.

B. Patients with crush injury require large volumes of fluid resuscitation. Patients with prolonged entrapment will require maintenance fluids. IO access should be considered when attempts at IV access are not successful if:
1. Prolonged entrapment is likely (30 minutes) and/or,
2. There are signs of hyperkalemia, and/or,
3. There is risk of crush syndrome requiring medication administration.

C. In cases of extended extrication, medications should be administered five minutes prior to release of the compressive force to prevent complications from the cellular toxins that enter the circulation system upon extrication of the patient. Calcium stabilizes the cardiac muscle and should be administered first.

D. Tourniquet placement prior to extrication is a last resort for patients who are at risk for crush syndrome in whom vascular access cannot be established or when transport time is anticipated to be > 30 minutes. The tourniquet must completely occlude venous and arterial flow in order to protect the patient from crush syndrome. Establish vascular access and cardiac monitoring immediately after extrication and be prepared to treat symptoms of crush syndrome.

## V. Base Orders

A. Additional administration of NS requires Base Hospital consult and physician approval.

B. The duration of action of the medications is approximately 30 minutes. For persistent signs of hyperkalemia and/or the patient will not arrive at the hospital within 30 minutes, re-dosing of medications requires Base Hospital consult and physician approval.

## VI. Contraindications

A. None.

## VII. Cross Reference

A. General Medical Care Policy No. 7001
B. Severe Pain Policy No. 7305
C. Uncontrolled Bleeding/Amputation Policy No. 7805
D. Spinal Motion Restriction Policy No. 7909
E. Hyperkalemia Policy No. 7303
