# Spinal Motion Restriction

**Policy Number:** 7909  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** May 19, 2020  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To provide guidance on the proper indication and application of spinal motion restriction.

## II. Scope

EMT-B, Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

**A. Determine need for SMR application:**

1. SMR should be considered for high risk trauma patients whose injuries/complaints may indicate spinal cord damage, including:
   a. Axial spine loading.
   b. Age > 65.
   c. Meets Coastal Valleys' trauma triage criteria per treatment guideline 7803 Trauma Triage.
   d. Numbness or tingling in extremities.

2. SMR is indicated if the high risk trauma patient (above) meets any of the following:
   
   a. **Unreliable patient:**
      1) Uncooperative.
      2) Altered Mental Status/abnormal GCS from baseline.
      3) Inability to communicate because of alcohol, drugs, language barrier, etc.
      4) Distracting injuries.
   
   b. **Spinal pain, tenderness, or deformity with palpation**
   
   c. **Abnormal motor/sensory exam:**
      1) Inability to perform wrist/hand extension bilaterally.
      2) Inability to perform foot plantarflexion or dorsiflexion bilaterally.
      3) Abnormal sensation.
      4) Pain/weakness/paresthesia with self-initiated movement.
   
   d. **No form of SMR required for:**
      1) Patients that do not meet the above criteria.
      2) Penetrating trauma patients without spinal pain or neuro deficits do not need SMR.

3. If patient meets SMR criteria, apply appropriate level of SMR.

## IV. Advance Life Support

None.

## V. Special Considerations

A. Multiple studies have shown that mechanism of injury is generally a poor indicator of injury and many patients are immobilized inappropriately.

B. Unstable spinal fractures are very rare, less than 1%.

C. Traditional full spinal immobilization, the current standard for almost all patients, may cause airway compromise, skin breakdown, and pain in virtually everyone, which often leads to unnecessary diagnostic procedures.

D. Most significant spinal injuries will present with spine pain, vertebral tenderness to palpation, and sometimes with neurologic symptoms and/or deficits. Alert and oriented patients with true spinal injuries will self-splint. These injuries are best recognized with a careful history and physical exam.

E. SMR should reduce, not increase, patient discomfort. SMR/immobilization that increases patient movement and/or pain should be avoided.

F. SMR should be accomplished using the most appropriate method/tool for each specific circumstance. This may include vacuum splints, stiff or soft cervical collars, KED, padded long boards, straps, head stabilization devices, and soft materials such as pillows and pull sheets.

G. No patient should be placed in SMR without being assessed using the Coastal Valleys' spinal injury assessment.

H. If there is any doubt about the presence of a spinal injury, apply SMR and defer further evaluation to the Emergency Department.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

None.

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. Inclusion/exclusion criteria.

B. Method and equipment used to apply SMR.

C. Neurologic status before and after SMR applied.

D. Neurologic status before and after movement.
