## II. Basic Life Support

A. Provide General Medical Care.

B. Do not delay transport.

D. Consider spinal motion restriction per procedure guideline 7909 Spinal Motion Restriction.

E. Remove or cut away patients clothing:
1. Cover patient with blanket to maintain body temperature and privacy.

F. If significant bleeding present, refer to treatment guideline 7805 Uncontrolled Bleeding/Amputation and 7910 Hemostatic Agents.

G. If suspected fracture present:
1. Pulses distal to the suspected fracture should be checked before and after movement or stabilization.

H. Provide pain management:
1. Stabilize suspected fractures in patients position of comfort.
2. Apply cold compress if indicated.

## III. Advanced Life Support

A. Establish IV.
1. Consider second IV when time allows.

B. Consider pain management per treatment guideline 7305 Severe Pain.

### Adult

**A. Treat suspected shock in patients with:**

1. Significant mechanism of injury.
2. Skin signs are pale cool, and diaphoretic.
3. SBP < 90 mmHg.
   a. Administer NS fluid bolus 250 ml IV as needed to maintain SBP 90 mmHg.
      (1) Max 1 L judiciously.
      (2) Warm fluids preferred.
   b. Consider administering Tranexamic Acid for suspected hemorrhagic shock per procedure guideline 7907 Tranexamic Acid Administration.

**B. Head injury with evidence of herniation:**

1. Ventilate patient to maintain capnography between 30 mmHg to 35 mmHg.

2. Consider sedation if patient is combative, extremely agitated, or clenched (trismus) per treatment guideline 7002 Sedation.

### Pediatric (less than 14 years of age)

**A. Treat suspected shock in patients with:**

1. Significant mechanism of injury.
2. Skin signs are pale, cool, and diaphoretic.
3. SBP is less than age appropriate parameters.
   a. Administer NS fluid bolus 20 ml/kg IV to maintain age appropriate SBP.
      (1) Do not repeat.
      (2) Warm fluids preferred.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. Expedite transport; on-scene time should be less than 10 minutes in the absence of prolonged extrication.

B. Studies indicate that trauma patients receiving excessive amounts of NS before going to the operating room may have worse outcomes. Fluid replacement should be administered judiciously to maintain a BP.

## V. Base Orders

## VI. Contraindications

A. Traction splints are contraindicated for suspected pelvic fractures.
1. The use of pelvic binder or sheet may be used to stabilize.
