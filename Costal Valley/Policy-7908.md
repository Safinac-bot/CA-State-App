# Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)

**Policy Number:** 7908  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** February 25, 2020  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To improve ventilation and oxygenation, and avoid intubation, in patients with moderate to severe respiratory distress.

B. **Indications:** Patients age 8 or older in moderate to severe respiratory distress secondary to:

1. CHF with pulmonary edema.
2. Acute exacerbation of COPD or asthma.
3. Pneumonia.
4. Near drowning.
5. Any other cause of respiratory failure.

## II. Scope

EMT-B, Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

A. Place patient in seated position.

B. Monitor BP, HR, RR, O2 saturation.

C. Set up CPAP system (per manufacturer's recommendation) with pressure set between 5-10 cm H2O.

D. Explain procedure to patient.

E. Apply mask while reassuring patient and encouraging patient to breath normally.

F. Re-evaluate the patient every 5 minutes.

G. Normally the patient will improve in the first 5 minutes with CPAP as evidenced by:
1. Decreased heart rate.
2. Decreased respiratory rate.
3. Decreased blood pressure.
4. Increased O2 saturation.

H. Bag-valve-mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation per Treatment Guideline 8801 Oral Intubation should be considered if the patient fails to show improvement.

## IV. Advance Life Support

None.

## V. Special Considerations

A. Complications may include:
1. Hypotension.
2. Pneumothorax.
3. Corneal drying.
4. Gastric distention.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

A. Respiratory or cardiac arrest

B. Tracheostomy

C. Agonal respirations

D. Signs and symptoms of pneumothorax

E. Inability to maintain airway patency

F. Major head or neck trauma

G. Vomiting

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. O2 Saturation prior to placement and every 5 minutes following placement.
