# Hyperkalemia

**Policy Number:** 7303  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** May 25, 2021  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Definition

A. Severe Hyperkalemia in the context of dialysis is common in end stage renal disease in patients who miss dialysis (which is the definitive treatment) that may result in EKG abnormalities and present in extremis.

B. EKG findings include peaked "T" waves, absent "P" waves, and/or widening of the QRS.

C. Crush Syndrome can develop when an individual is entrapped with extensive tissue involvement. Patients with Crush syndrome are at risk for developing Hyperkalemia.

## II. Basic Life Support

A. Provide General Medical Care.

B. Monitor closely for signs of cardiac arrest and defibrillate without delay.

## III. Advanced Life Support

A. Obtain 12 Lead EKG per procedure guideline 7103 EKG 12-Lead, looking for severe signs of hyperkalemia.

### Adult

**A. In the presence of altered mental status, chest pain, unexplained bradycardias, nausea/vomiting, and/or crush syndrome:**

1. Administer Calcium Chloride 1 gm slow IVP over 2 minutes.

2. In second separate IV, administer Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IVP over 1 minute.

3. Administer Albuterol (no Atrovent) 5 mg in 6 ml NS via nebulized device.

### Pediatric (less than 14 years of age)

**A. In the presence of altered mental status, chest pain, unexplained bradycardias, nausea/vomiting, and/or crush syndrome:**

1. Administer Calcium Chloride per pediatric medication administration guide.

2. In second separate IV, administer Sodium Bicarbonate per pediatric medication administration guide.

3. Administer Albuterol (no Atrovent) per pediatric medication administration guide.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. If treatment is successful, you should see an increase in GCS and resolution in EKG abnormalities.

B. In cases of crush syndrome with extended extrication, medications should be administered five minutes prior to release of the compressive force to prevent complications from the cellular toxins that enter the circulation system upon extrication of the patient. Calcium stabilizes the cardiac muscle and should be administered first.

## V. Base Orders

A. For repeat doses or if no changes noted after treatment consult with Base Hospital.

## VI. Contraindications

A. Do not run Sodium Bicarbonate and Calcium Chloride concurrently. Either flush the line well or establish a separate IV.

## VII. Cross Reference

A. General Medical Care Policy No. 7001
B. 12-Lead EKG Policy No. 7103
C. Crush Syndrome Policy No. 7804
