# Trauma Triage Decision Scheme

**Policy Number:** 7803

## Step 1 – Physiological Factors

**Any one element triggers a Trauma Destination**

### Adult Patients (age 15 - 65)
1. GCS of thirteen (13) or less, or,
2. Systolic BP < 90 mm Hg

### Geriatric Patients (age > 65 yrs)
1. GCS change from baseline, or,
2. Systolic BP <110 mmHg

### Pediatric Patients (age <15 yrs)
1. GCS of thirteen (13) or less, or,
2. Systolic BP < 80 mmHg - age 7-15, or,
3. Systolic BP < 70 mmHg - age < 7

**Transport to closest appropriate Trauma Center**

## Step 2 - Major Anatomic Factors

**Any one element triggers a Trauma Destination**

- Penetrating injury to head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, groin, or extremities proximal to elbow or knee.
- Two or more proximal long-bone fractures.
- Open or depressed skull fracture.
- Chest wall instability or deformity.
- Pelvic fracture.
- Amputation proximal to wrist or ankle.
- Traumatic paralysis or paresthesia.
- Crushed, de-gloved, or mangled extremity.
- Combination of trauma with burns greater than or equal to 15 percent of the body surface area, or burns to the face or airway.
- Any patient < 5 years of age who has suffered major trauma but for whom it's not possible to determine physiologic status.

**Transport to closest appropriate Trauma Center**

## Step 3 - Mechanism of Injury Factors

1. Ejected from vehicle, e.g., auto, jet ski, or motorcycle traveling > 20 mph
2. Death in the same passenger compartment
3. Extrication time greater than 20 minutes
4. Rollover without seatbelt
5. Fall greater than 20 feet. In pediatrics, greater than 10 feet or 2-3 times the child's height.
6. Auto-pedestrian or auto-bicycle with greater than 20 mph impact.
7. High speed motor vehicle collision and significant passenger space intrusion
8. Significant blunt injury to head, neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis without co-existing anatomic or physiologic factor.
9. Ground level fall with head trauma for whom you assess a high risk of injury (on anticoagulation, except aspirin).

**Assess anatomic factors → Transport to closest appropriate hospital**

## Step 4 - Additional Factors

### Physiologic & Anatomic Factors

1. Torso, abdomen, or pelvic complaint.
2. Persistent & unexplained respiratory difficulty, tachycardia, or peripheral vaso-constriction.
3. Extremity ischemia as demonstrated by absent pulses and pallor.

### Age and Comorbid Factors

1. Age less than 5 yrs & difficult to evaluate or age greater than 65 yrs.
2. Pregnancy greater or equal to 20 weeks.
3. Pt with bleeding disorder or on anticoagulants or antiplatelet (Coumadin or Plavix) except ASA.
4. Inability to communicate; i.e. language, psychological and/or substance impairment.
5. EMS provider judgement.
