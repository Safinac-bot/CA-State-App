# Hazardous Material Exposure

**Policy Number:** 7205  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** February 23, 2021  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Definition

A. **Hazardous Material:** Any material that poses a significant present or potential hazard to humans or the environment due to its quantity, concentration, and/or physical or chemical characteristics.

B. **Decontamination (Decon):** The process of removing contaminants from people and equipment. There are three levels of Decon.

1. **Emergency Decon:** Done by removing clothing and spraying patient with a hose to remove contaminants.
2. **Mass Decon:** Setting up fog streams or using a commercially available tent to decontaminate multiple victims.
3. **Technical Decon:** The process used to decontaminate responders and equipment at an incident.

## II. Basic Life Support

A. When a hazardous material event is identified:

1. Stay uphill, upwind, and upstream.

2. Use the acronym SIN:
   a. **Safety First:** Keep responders and the public safe by staying away from the hazard and prevent secondary contamination by keeping distance from patients until decontaminated.
   b. **Isolated and Deny Entry:** Establish an exclusion zone appropriate to the size of the incident.
   c. **Notification:** Notify the appropriate resources such as Law Enforcement (evacuations/investigations), dispatch, Fire Department/HAZMAT, and/or additional EMS units if multiple patients suspected.

B. Provide General Medical Care after the patient has been appropriately decontaminated.

C. Use reference resources to determine level of risks of the substance:
1. Emergency Response Guidebook for transportation events.
2. NIOSH Pocket Guide.
3. WISER online resource (Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders).

D. Early notification to receiving facility identifying patient as having a HAZMAT exposure, identification of substance if known, and patient decontamination status.
1. Do not transport a patient prior to appropriate decontamination.
2. Do not enter the ED until directed by ED staff.

E. For ingestions, do not induce vomiting.
1. If patient does vomit, treat vomit as a hazardous material.

F. For skin exposures, remove clothing and wash skin with water.

G. For eye exposures, flush eyes with NS.

## III. Advanced Life Support

### Adult

**A. Insecticides: Organophosphates, Carbamates**

1. If signs of significant exposure (bradycardia, salivation, vomiting/diarrhea, wheezing, hypotension):
   a. Administer Atropine 2 mg slow IVP.
      1) May repeat if symptoms persist.
      2) Max dose 8 mg.

### Pediatric (less than 14 years of age)

**A. Insecticides: Organophosphates, Carbonates**

1. If signs of significant exposure (bradycardia, salivation, vomiting/diarrhea, wheezing, hypotension):
   a. Administer Atropine per pediatric medication administration guide.
      1) May repeat if symptoms persist.
      2) Max dose 4 mg.

## IV. Special Considerations

A. Depending on the severity of exposure and the substance, emergency decon may be performed by a lay medical first responder, i.e. Pepper Spray. However, some exposures require decontamination to be performed by trained HAZMAT responders. All responders shall use judgement and take appropriate precautions to prevent secondary contamination.

B. Significant organophosphate exposures often times require greater Atropine dosage to achieve symptom resolution.

C. For decontamination, ensure all clothing is removed for physical contamination. This removes approximately 80% of the substance/contaminate.

D. Pepper Spray should be consider a hazardous exposure and patients should be appropriately decontaminated prior to transport and entering the ED.

## V. Base Orders

A. Atropine dosing greater than max dose requires Base Hospital consult and physician approval/order.
