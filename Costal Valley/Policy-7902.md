## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To provide guidance on the removal of football helmets in the prehospital setting.

## II. Scope

EMT-B, Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

A. Remove face shield.

B. Maintain cervical neutrality while first removing the helmet.

C. After the helmet is successfully removed maintain spinal neutrality by holding manual cervical immobilization.

D. Remove shoulder padding by cutting the pad laces.
1. If unable to cut pad laces, coordinate a slight lift of the torso to slide the pads off.
   a. Maintain spinal neutrality during this process may require up to 4 personnel.

E. Evaluate the need for continuous spinal motion restriction per treatment guideline 7909 Spinal Motion Restriction.

## IV. Advanced Life Support

None.

## V. Special Considerations

A. Helmets in conjunction with shoulder pads help immobilize the neck in neutral spinal alignment. If the helmet is removed, and the shoulder pads are left in place, the head could fall back into extension due to the bulk of the pads. If the helmet must be removed, it should be taken off simultaneously with the shoulder pads while constantly maintaining a neutral spine.

B. Removal of a football helmet should be reserved for patients where protective equipment is interfering with appropriate spinal motion restriction or if the airway cannot be managed.

C. Helmets are typically radiolucent and will not interfere with plain X-rays or CT scans.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

None.

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. CSM evaluation before and after helmet removal.
