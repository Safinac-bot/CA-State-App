## PURPOSE

a. To establish routine procedures to assist EMS personnel with calls involving the death of children in the pre-hospital setting. Goals of these procedures include minimizing the stress placed on parents and other family members, providing avenues for support to parents and families, and preventing scene contamination and disruption.

## PROCEDURE

**a. Determine whether to perform further resuscitation measures:**

1. If patient does not exhibit lividity or rigor, and there is no authorized DNR present, proceed with CPR and follow applicable resuscitation treatment policies.

2. If patient exhibits lividity and rigor, do not resuscitate or transport. If in the EMS personnel's judgment, transport will be beneficial due to scene conditions, transport may be initiated.

**b. Provide supportive measures for parents and siblings:**

1. Do not express your assumptions or judgments regarding the cause of death.

2. Explain the resuscitation process, transport decision, and further actions to be taken by hospital personnel or the medical examiner.

3. Use the child's first name.

4. Allow parent to see the child and say goodbye.

5. Maintain a supportive, professional attitude no matter how the parents react.

6. Whenever possible, be responsive to parental requests.

7. Be sensitive to ethnic and religious needs or response and make allowances for them.

8. Assist family with contacting grief support if available.

**c. Obtain a patient history. Use a non-judgmental approach. Ask open ended questions as follows:**

1. When was your child well? What has changed or occurred since then?

2. Has the child been sick?

3. Who found the child? Where?

4. Has the child been moved?

5. What time was the child last seen breathing?

6. Was the child taking any medications?

7. What was done after the child was discovered?

8. When did the child eat last?

## DOCUMENTATION
