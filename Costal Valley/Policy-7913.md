# Needle Thoracostomy

**Policy Number:** 7913  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** May 19, 2020  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To provide guidelines on the indications and procedure of needle thoracostomy placement.

B. **Indications:**

1. Trauma patients with obvious chest trauma (i.e. open chest wounds, evidence of crush or flail segment), or a mechanism consistent with chest trauma who demonstrates:
   a. Decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side, AND
   b. SBP < 90mmHg in adults, <70mmHg in children and infants AND
   c. One or more of the following:
      1) Altered mental status
      2) Severe respiratory distress with a respiratory rate > 30 or < 10 breaths per minute
      3) Severe hypoxemia with O2 sat < 90%
      4) Cool, pale, moist skin

2. Traumatic full arrest with PEA rhythm. Bilateral needle thoracostomy should be performed if evidence of chest wall trauma.

3. Trauma patients requiring positive pressure ventilation (via BVM or advanced airway) who develop hypoxemia or severe hypotension after the initiation of positive pressure ventilation.

4. PEA cardiac arrest that started after the initiation of positive pressure ventilation.

C. **Equipment:**
1. 8cm (3.25 inch) 14g needle over catheter. Children < 5 yrs old use 18g angio-catheter.
2. Large syringe.
3. Alcohol or Chlorhexidine.
4. Tape or commercial securing device.

## II. Scope

Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

None.

## IV. Advance Life Support

**A. Location:**

1. The 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line, just over the top of the 3rd rib. This is usually found 2 fingers below the clavicle OR

2. The 4th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line, just over the top of the 5th rib.

**B. Procedure:**

1. Attach a syringe to the thoracostomy needle. Carefully advance the needle perpendicular to the chest wall while withdrawing on the syringe until air is aspirated, confirming penetration into the pleural space. Advance the needle an additional 1cm before further advancing the catheter and withdrawing the needle.

2. Secure the catheter to the skin with tape or the securing devise.

3. Do not place a one-way valve on the catheter hub.

## V. Special Considerations

A. The procedure of needle thoracostomy in pediatric patients is unchanged from that of adults. It is expected that a shorter distance will need to be traversed to enter the pleural space in children due to the thinner chest wall.

B. It is rare for COPD/ASTHMA patients to develop a tension pneumothorax outside of the setting of positive pressure ventilation. Base hospital contact is recommended before considering a needle thoracostomy in these patients.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

None.

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. Indications for performing the procedure.

B. Any improvements post procedure.

C. Complications.

D. EtCO2 Wave form before and after placement if available.

E. SPO2 before and after placement.
