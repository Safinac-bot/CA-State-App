## PURPOSE

a. To provide procedures for EMS personnel to follow when patients, parents, or legal representative refuse indicated medical treatment or ambulance transportations.

## DEFINITIONS

a. **Adult:** For purposes of this policy, a person at least eighteen years of age, or an emancipated minor.

b. **Minor:** A person less than eighteen years of age who is not emancipated.

c. **Emancipated Minor:** A person less than 18 years of age who:
   1. Is married or previously married
   2. Is on active duty in the military
   3. Is an emancipated minor (decreed by court, identification card by DMV)

d. **Competent:** The patient is alert and oriented and has the capacity to understand the circumstances surrounding his/her illness or impairment, and the risks associated with refusing treatment or transport.

e. **Emergency:** Condition or situation in which an individual has a need for immediate medical attention or where the potential for need is perceived by EMS personnel or a public safety agency.

f. **"Individual not requiring transport" or "release at scene":** An individual who, after a complete assessment by ALS personnel, does not appear to have a medical problem that requires immediate treatment and/or transportation by the medical system.

g. **Refusing care against medical advice (AMA):** A competent adult who is determined by EMS or base hospital personnel to have a medical problem which requires the immediate treatment and/or transport capabilities of the EMS system, and who has been advised of his/her condition and the known and unknown risks and/or possible complications of refusing medical care, and who still declines treatment or transport.

h. **5150:** Refers to a patient who is held against his/her will for evaluation under the authority of Welfare and Institutions Code, Section 5150, because the patient is a danger to him/herself, a danger to others, and/or gravely disabled, e.g., unable to care for self. This written order may be placed by a law enforcement officer, County mental health worker, or an emergency physician certified by the County to place an individual on a 5150 hold.

## PRINCIPLES

a. A competent adult or a competent emancipated minor has the right to determine the course of his/her own medical care and shall be allowed to make decisions affecting his/her medical care, including the refusal of care.

b. With the exceptions of minors who have clear legal capacity to refuse emergency treatment or transport (emancipated minors) a patient less than 18 years old must have a parent or legal representative present to refuse evaluation, treatment, or transport.

c. An adult or emancipated minor may refuse medical evaluation, treatment, and/or ambulance/medical transportation, provided that he/she is competent and has been advised of the risk and consequences, which may result in refusal of evaluation, treatment and/or transportation.

d. Refusal of evaluation, treatment and/or transportation should not be considered for patients who do not have the capacity to make competent decisions regarding their own care. A patient's competence may be significantly impaired by mental illness, drug or alcohol intoxication, physical or mental impairment. Patients, who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal intent or when other factors lead EMS personnel to suspect suicidal intent, should not be regarded as competent.

## PROCEDURE

a. When a competent adult or emancipated minor refuses indicated emergency treatment or transportation, EMS personnel shall:

1. Advice the patient of the risks and consequences which may result from refusal of treatment or transport.

2. If the patient's condition meets ALS treatment criteria, and a BLS unit is alone on scene, an ALS unit should be requested.

3. Have the patient or his/her legal representative, as appropriate, sign the release (AMA) section of the RAS/AMA form. The signature shall be witnessed, preferably by a family member. The patient should be advised to arrange for medical care immediately, if appropriate, or if he/she develops adverse symptoms at a later time. If the patient requests additional medical advice, the base hospital should be involved.

4. If the patient refuses to sign the AMA form, this fact should be documented on the form.

5. If EMS personnel determine that a patient with an emergency condition is not competent to refuse evaluation, treatment or transport, the following alternatives exist:
   
   a) Patient should be transported to an appropriate facility under implied consent. In this case, a 5150 hold is not necessary.
   
   b) If EMS personnel determine it is necessary to transport the patient against his/her will and the patient resists or the EMS personnel believe the patient will resist, assistance from law enforcement should be requested in transporting the patient. The police may consider the placement of a 5150 hold on the patient, but this is not required for transport.
   
   c) If EMS personnel believe a parent or other legal representative of the patient is acting unreasonably in refusing indicated immediate care or transport, law enforcement authorities should be involved.

**NOTE:** At no time are field personnel to put themselves in danger by attempting to transport or treat a patient who refuses. At all times, good judgment should be used and appropriate assistance obtained.

## RELEASE AT SCENE

a. When ALS personnel have been called to an incident and have determined that an adult or emancipated minor does not require treatment and/or transport, the patient may be released at scene. The patient should be advised to arrange for medical care if he/she develops adverse symptoms at a later time.

b. A patient released at scene should NOT sign an AMA form, as this implies that the patient is at significant risk by not utilizing the EMS system for treatment and/or transportation. ALS personnel shall document any advice given to the patient regarding follow-up treatment.

## 5150

a. Patients exhibiting signs of being a danger to themselves or others, or are gravely disabled, cannot be released at scene. EMS personnel should notify the proper authorities to request a 5150 determination and remain with the patient until authorities have made such a determination.

## DOCUMENTATION

a. A PCR and a RAS/AMA form must be competed for each incident of patient refusal of emergency medical evaluation, care and/or transportation. EMS personnel shall ensure that documentation includes a patient history and assessment, details of the exam/evaluation that was performed, a description of the patient that clearly indicates his/her decision-making capacity, why the patient is refusing care, a statement that the patient understands the risks and consequences of refusing medical attention, and any alternatives presented to the patient.
