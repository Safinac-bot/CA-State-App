# Pre-Existing Vascular Device

**Policy Number:** 7914  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** May 19, 2020  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To provide vascular access for patients in extremis due to circulatory shock or cardiopulmonary arrest with no other vascular access available.

B. **Indications:**
1. Only in the absence of any other observable vascular access, when the patient has:
   a. Cardiopulmonary arrest.
   b. Extremis due to circulatory shock.

C. **Policy:**
1. Paramedics may access pre-existing vascular access devices under appropriate circumstances. They may encounter various types of catheters. A pre-existing vascular access device is an indwelling catheter/device placed into one of the central veins to provide vascular access for those patients requiring long term intravenous therapy or hemodialysis. The types of catheters used are:
   
   a. **Indwelling silastic catheter/device exiting externally:** (Broviac, Hickman and others); silicone catheter inserted into SCV or the right atrium usually via the cephalic vein; enter the skin through an incision in the right anterior chest; line is kept heparinized and protected by an injectable cap.
   
   b. **Hemodialysis shunt:** a tube that diverts blood flow from an artery to a vein.
   
   c. **Internal subcutaneous infusion ports/fistulas:** any access that is subcutaneous requiring entry through the skin. Not recommended for use in the prehospital setting.

## II. Scope

Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

None.

## IV. Advance Life Support

**A. Procedure:**

1. Due to the location of the catheter, strict adherence to aseptic technique is crucial when handling a PVAD:
   a. Use sterile gloves;
   b. Prep injectable port and surrounding skin with alcohol swab prior to attaching I.V. tubing;
   c. Use new supplies if equipment becomes contaminated;
   d. Recover port with sterile dressing and securely tape.

B. The PVAD provides a direct line into the central circulation; introduction of air into these devices can be hazardous.

**C. Approved Infusions:**
1. Intravenous solutions
2. All medications except diazepam (Valium) as it interacts with silicone causing crystallization of the medications and deterioration of the silicone.
3. Follow all medications with 5 ml of saline to avoid clots.

## V. Special Considerations

A. Do not remove injection cap from catheter.

B. Do not allow I.V. fluids to run dry.

C. Always expel air from preload/syringe prior to administration.

D. Do not inject medications of fluids if resistance is met when establishing patency.

E. Should damage occur to the external catheter, clamp immediately between the skin exit site and the damaged area to prevent air embolism or blood loss.

F. Use padded hemostats.

G. Do not use a syringe smaller than 10 ml to prevent catheter damage from excess infusion pressure.

H. Do not manipulate or remove an indwelling catheter under any circumstances.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

None.

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. Indications for performing the procedure.

B. Identify any infusions or medications administered.
