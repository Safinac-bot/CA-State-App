**F. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter:**

Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter is typically a well-tolerated rhythm that does not require aggressive therapy. Assess patient for other possible causes if symptomatic. Attempts to convert rhythm should be reserved for the patient in extremis.

1. If SBP < 90 mmHg:
   a. Administer NS fluid bolus 250 ml IV.
      1) Repeat once as indicated to maintain SBP > 90 mmHg.
      2) Recheck vitals every 250 ml.

2. If dysrhythmia persists and SBP < 80 mmHg with acute altered mental status present:
   a. Escalating synchronized cardioversion per treatment guideline 7920 synchronized cardioversion.

3. Optional rate reducing treatment for transport times in excess of one hour:
   a. Obtain 12-Lead EKG per procedure guideline 9808 EKG 12-Lead to verify underlying rhythm.
   b. If SBP > 120 mmHg and 12 Lead EKG confirms Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter:
      1) Administer Verapamil 2.5 mg IV.
         a) The absence of fever (38° C or 100.4°F) must be documented.
         b) Repeat every 10 minutes.
         c) Max dose 15 mg.
         d) If heart rate falls below 100 BPM administration should stop.

            i. Administer NS fluid bolus 10 ml/kg IV.
               i) Recheck vitals every 250 ml.

         f) Do not use Verapamil in wide complex QRS dysrhythmias or patients with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW).

## IV. Special Considerations

**Adult:**
