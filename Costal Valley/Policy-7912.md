# Supraglottic Airway

**Policy Number:** 7912  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2020  
**Review Date:** May 19, 2020  
**Approved:** Bryan Cleaver, EMS Administrator  
Mark Luoto, EMS Medical Director  
**Authority:** California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 EMS, Sections 1797.220 & 1797.221

## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To provide guidelines on the indications and procedure of supraglottic airways.

B. **Indications:**
1. Cardiac Arrest.
2. Respiratory arrest with no immediately reversible cause.
3. Obtunded patient with compromised airway.

C. **Criteria:**
1. Accredited EMTs who worked for approved providers, may use an approved SGA as an advanced rescue airway for adult patients in cardiac arrest when BLS maneuvers are unsuccessful.
2. Paramedics for patients weighing 2 kg or more.

D. **Equipment:** Appropriately sized SGA â€“ i-Gel is the SGA device that is authorized for use by CVEMSA. Other SGAs may be approved in the future if appropriate.
1. Water based lubricant.
2. Suction device.
3. Strap or tape for securing SGA.
4. Bag valve mask (BVM).
5. Stethoscope.
6. Pulse oximetry device.
7. End tidal capnography device.
8. Tongue blade.

E. **Educational requirements/Quality assurance:**

### 1. Educational Requirements:
a. Successful completion of a SGA skills training approved by CVEMSA.
b. Successfully complete a semi-annual skills competency as defined by CVEMSA.

### 2. Quality Assurance:
a. 100% audit of all SGA attempts will be reviewed by the ALS Provider's Clinical Coordinator.
b. A report will be provided by the ALS Provider's Clinical Coordinator to the CVEMSA QI Committee.

### 3. Quality Assurance Metrics:

a. **Rescue Device Needed:** YES/NO/NOT DOCUMENTED (Rescue Device is defined as a device used after the failure of the initial device attempted for secondary management, after bag-mask ventilation).

b. **Successful Placement:** YES/NO/NOT DOCUMENTED (Successful Placement is defined as the ability to ventilate the patient with minimal or no air leak, confirmed with all of the following: visible chest rise during ventilation, air movement with auscultation, and ETCO2 measurement with capnography).

c. **Number of Attempts:** DOCUMENTED/NOT DOCUMENTED (Attempt is defined as insertion of the SGA device into the mouth).

d. **Time to Insertion:** IN SECONDS/NOT DOCUMENTED (Time to Insertion is defined as the time from insertion of the SGA into the mouth for the first attempt until the time of the first successful ventilation with minimal or no air leak).

e. **Complications:**
   1) **Regurgitation/Emesis:** YES/NO/NOT DOCUMENTED (Regurgitation is defined as the presence of gastric contents noted in the oropharynx or on the device during or after placement).
   
   2) **Bleeding/Trauma:** YES/NO/NOT DOCUMENTED (Bleeding/Trauma is defined as the presence of blood noted in the oropharynx or on the device during or after placement, or any abrasion/laceration/dental trauma or other trauma occurring during the placement or repositioning of the device. This excludes bleeding or trauma present prior to attempting device placement).
   
   3) **Hypoxia:** YES/NO/NOT DOCUMENTED (Hypoxia is defined as any O2 saturation <90% during or after placement in a patient that was not hypoxic prior to placement).
   
   4) **Dislodgement:** YES/NO/NOT DOCUMENTED (Dislodgement is defined as loss of the ability to adequately ventilate the patient after successful placement was achieved).
      a) If Dislodgement after placement, successful replacement: YES/NO/NOT DOCUMENTED/NOT APPLICABLE (Successful replacement is defined as the ability to ventilate the patient with minimal or no air leak, after dislodgment and replacement of the same device, confirmed with all of the following: visible chest rise during ventilation, air movement on auscultation and ETCO2 measurement with capnography).

## II. Scope

EMT-B, Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

A. Assure a patent airway, oxygenation and ventilation.

B. Assure that a cardiac monitor and pulse oximetry is applied.

C. Pre-oxygenate with 100% oxygen for 2-3 minutes, targeting >94% O2 sat.

D. Apply a chin lift and introduce tongue blade into the mouth.

E. Insert the SGA into the mouth.

F. Advance the tip over the base of the tongue.

G. Advance the tube without using excessive force until definitive resistance is felt. The position guide should be aligned with the teeth or gums.

H. Attach the BVM and ventilate at the appropriate rate.

## IV. Advance Life Support

A. Connect the EtCO2 device.

## V. Special Considerations

A. Ventilate at age appropriate rates. Do not hyperventilate. Aim for O2 sat of 88-92% in COPD patients, 94-98% in all others.

B. Post ROSC patients should be ventilated at 8-10 breaths per minute with low tidal volumes.

C. If the intubated patient deteriorates, think "DOPE".
1. Dislodgement.
2. Obstruction.
3. Pneumothorax.
4. Equipment failure (no oxygen).

D. Reconfirm and document correct tube position, preferably with waveform capnography, after moving the patient and before disconnecting from monitor in the ED.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

A. Intact gag reflex.

B. Severe airway trauma.

C. Severe airway edema.

D. Airway obstruction.

E. Caustic ingestion.

F. Trismus.

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. Number of intubation attempts if attempted prior to supraglottic airway attempts.

B. Successful or unsuccessful supraglottic airway attempts.

C. Complications.

D. Correct tube position.

E. Reassessment of placement every 2-3 minutes.

F. EtCO2 Wave form if applicable to scope.

G. SPO2 before and after placement.
