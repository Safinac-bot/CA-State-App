## I. Principles

A. **Purpose:** To provide guidelines on the indications and procedure to obtain Intraosseous (IO) Vascular Access to treat critically ill patients when a peripheral IV cannot be established.

B. **Indications:**

1. Intravenous fluids or medications are urgently needed and a peripheral IV cannot be established in two (2) attempts or within 90 seconds and the patient exhibits one or more of the following:
   a. GCS of 8 or less.
   b. Imminent respiratory failure.
   c. Hemodynamic instability (SBP < 90 mmHg).

2. Cardiopulmonary or traumatic arrest in which it may be obvious that attempts at placing an IV would likely be unsuccessful and/or too time consuming, resulting in a delay of life saving fluids or medications.

C. **Equipment:**
1. Approved Intraosseous infusion need/device (EZ-IO or bone injection gun).
2. Alcohol or Chlorhexidine.
3. 10 ml Normal Saline syringe.
4. Standard extension set.
5. 2% Lidocaine per treatment guideline 7305 Pain Management.

## II. Scope

Paramedic

## III. Basic Life Support

None.

## IV. Advance Life Support

**A. Location:**
1. Proximal tibia.
2. Distal tibia.
3. Proximal Humeral

**B. Procedure:**

1. Clean the site appropriately.

2. Stabilize the selected extremity/site.

3. Insert needle from a 90-degree angle.

4. When needle is in the position, remove stylet.

5. Connect extension tubing primed with normal saline.

6. Confirm proper placement by rapid IV Push of NS through the IO with a10 cc prefilled syringe.

7. Consider pain management per treatment guideline 7305 pain management for awake patients prior to other medication administration.

8. Dress site and secure device.

9. Apply appropriate identification such as a wristband.

## V. Special Considerations

None.

## VI. Base Orders

None.

## VII. Contraindications

A. Fracture of the bones selected for IO placement (consider an alternate site).

B. Excessive tissue at the insertion site with the absence of anatomical landmarks.

C. Previous significant orthopedic procedure within the last 24 hours

D. Signs on infection at the site.

## VIII. Documentation on the EMS patient care report (PCR) shall include:

A. Indications for performing the procedure.

B. Any improvements post procedure.
