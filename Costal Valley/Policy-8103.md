## PURPOSE

a. To monitor thoracostomy tubes previously established.

## EQUIPMENT

a. Firm plastic thoracostomy tube.

b. Negative pressure drainage receptacle attached to the thoracostomy tube to form a closed drainage system.

c. Rubber-tipped clamp.

## PRECAUTIONS

a. Keep drainage receptacle below level of chest to prevent drained fluid from re-entering pleural space.

b. Keep drainage tubing in view.

c. Do not permit dependent loops of kinks to form, as this will increase pleural pressure, formation of clots or interference with the flow of drainage.

d. Keep dressing at insertion site secure to prevent air entering the pleural space.

e. Maintain aseptic technique.

f. Do not disconnect drainage system or puncture tubing.

g. Tape all connections securely to prevent violation of sterility and loss of negative drainage pressure.

h. Avoid pulling on thoracostomy tube to prevent accidental dislodging of the tube.

## COMPLICATIONS

a. Complications require immediate intervention. Contact the base hospital to report the problem, the intervention taken and to request further assistance.

### b. Tube dislodgement or withdrawal.

1. If accidental withdrawal of tube occurs, place occlusive dressing over insertion site.

2. If the tube becomes dislodged or a malfunction with air leak occurs in the system, clamp the tube close to the chest wall and observe for signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax.

### c. Drained fluid re-enters pleural space.

1. If drained fluid re-enters the pleural space place receptacle below level of chest to facilitate gravity drainage.

### d. Hemorrhage through tube

1. If hemorrhage occurs through chest tube, observe for signs and symptoms of shock and treat according to protocol.

### e. Receptacle fills in transit.

1. Keep in position.
2. Do not remove or elevate.
