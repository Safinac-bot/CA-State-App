## History

- DNR, POLST, Living will
- Events leading to arrest
- Estimated downtime
- History of current illness
- Past medical history
- Medications
- Existence of terminal illness

## Differential

- Medical vs. trauma
- VF vs. pulseless VT
- Asystole
- PEA
- Primary cardiac event vs. respiratory arrest or drug overdose

## Signs and Symptoms

- Unresponsive
- Apneic
- Pulseless

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Initial Assessment

**Criteria for death/no resuscitation:**
- Review DNR/POLST form
- Decomposition
- Rigor mortis
- Dependent lividity
- Injury incompatible with life or unwitnessed traumatic arrest with asystole

**If above criteria met:** Do not begin resuscitation. Follow Policy 1004.V.A.5 â€“ Termination of Resuscitation

### Cardiac Monitoring

- Apply cardiac monitor
- Assess rhythm

### CPR - Continuous Compressions

**Begin continuous chest compressions:**
- Push hard (> 2 inches) and fast (100-120/min)
- Use metronome to ensure proper rate
- Change compressors every 2 minutes (Limit changes/pulse checks to < 5 seconds)
- Apply mechanical compression device if available
- 2 min intervals
- Assess and repeat

**Apply AED if available**

**EtCO2 monitoring**

### Airway Management

**After 6 minutes:**
- Basic airway procedure
- Ventilation with BVM (1 breath every 10 seconds)

### Rhythm Assessment

**Is ALS available?**

#### If Shockable rhythm (VF/VT):
- **Automated defibrillation**
- CPR
- Continuous compressions
- 2 min intervals
- Assess and repeat
- **Exit to VF/VT TG**

#### If Non-Shockable rhythm (Asystole/PEA):
- CPR
- Continuous compressions
- 2 min intervals
- Assess and repeat
- **Exit to Asystole/PEA TG**

### Return of Spontaneous Circulation

**At any time if ROSC achieved:**
- **Exit to Post ROSC TG**

### Special Considerations

**For suspected Excited Delirium patients:**
- Consider fluid bolus early
- Contact Base Hospital for Sodium Bicarbonate order

## Pearls

- **Maternal arrest:** Treat mother per appropriate TG with immediate notification to the Base Hospital along with rapid transport. Place pillows or padding underneath mother to displace fetus from inferior vena cava as to ensure continued fetal blood circulation; left lateral position. IV/IO access should be preferably placed above the diaphragm. Defibrillation is safe at all energy levels.

- Resuscitation is based on proper planning and organized execution. Procedures require space and patient access. Make room to work. Utilize a team focused approach assigning responders to predetermined tasks.

- Per AHA 2020 guidelines, "It is reasonable for providers to first attempt establishing IV access for drug administration in Cardiac Arrest. IO access may be considered if attempts at IV access are unsuccessful or not feasible."

- Efforts should be directed at high quality and continuous chest compressions with limited interruptions.

- Do not delay chest compressions while applying any device or intervention.

- In cases of clear-cut traumatic arrest, epinephrine is not indicated in PEA or asystole. Epinephrine will not correct arrest caused by a tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or hemorrhagic shock. If there is any doubt as to the cause of arrest, treat as a non-traumatic arrest.

- The AutoPulse device is limited to 80 compressions/minute, which is acceptable when using this device during cardiac arrest.

- **Passive ventilation for the first three cycles (6 minutes) of CPR.** After that time, the patient should be ventilated using a BLS airway and BVM at a rate of 6 ventilation/minute (1:10 seconds) with continuous CPR.

- Placement of an advanced airway is recommended in patients who achieve ROSC or when the provider is unable to ventilate the patient with a BLS airway and BVM.

- Use a metronome during chest compression to ensure proper rate unless a mechanical CPR device is deployed.

- Reassess and document advanced airway placement and EtCO2 frequently, after every move, and at transfer of care.

- If a non-shockable rhythm persists for 30 minutes despite aggressive resuscitative efforts, consider cessation of efforts as outlined in the Determination of Death policy.
