## Treatment Protocol

### Assess Symptom Severity

**Any signs of airway compromise OR Other significant systemic signs?**

#### MILD (Skin symptoms +/- mild GI symptoms)

1. **Administer Oxygen with goal of ≥ 94% SpO2**

2. **Establish IV/IO**

3. **Cardiac monitor**

4. **For urticaria or angioedema consider:**
   - **Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV/IO/IM**

---

#### MODERATE/SEVERE (Airway compromise or significant systemic signs)

1. **If available, assist patient with self-prescribed Epinephrine Auto-Injector**
   - **Administer Epinephrine Auto-Injector**
   - Use Pediatric Epinephrine Auto-Injector for patients >50 years of age

2. **Administer Oxygen with goal of ≥ 94% SpO2**

3. **Establish IV/IO**

4. **Epinephrine (1 mg/ml) 0.3 mg IM**
   - (Use 0.15 mg for patients > 50 years of age)

5. **Cardiac monitor**

6. **For wheezing consider Albuterol nebulizer 5mg**
   - Repeat as needed

7. **Consider Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV/IO/IM**

### Signs of Shock Assessment

**Signs of shock? SBP <90?**

**If Yes:**

1. **Normal Saline bolus 500 ml IV/IO**
   - Repeat as needed to Max of 1L

2. **SBP <90 5-10 min post IM Epinephrine?**
   
   **If Yes:**
   - **Epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml) titrated in 0.1 mg increments slow IV/IO**
   - Maximum 0.5 mg

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Anaphylaxis is a systemic allergic reaction with involvement of the following body systems: skin/mucous membranes, airway or GI systems. Mild anaphylaxis that does not involve the airway may not require epinephrine.

- For allergic reactions with airway compromise of moderate-severe anaphylaxis, intramuscular Epinephrine is the first line treatment and should be given early in the course of care. It is best absorbed from injection in the lateral thigh.

- Diphenhydramine may help with skin manifestations of an allergic reaction but has no role in treating the respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms in anaphylaxis. Consider a reduced dosage if patient has had Diphenhydramine in the past 1-2 hours.

- Allergic reactions/anaphylaxis may occur with only respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and have no rash or skin involvement.

- Angioedema is seen as swelling involving the face, lips, tongue or airway structures. This can also be seen in patients taking ACE-inhibitor blood pressure medications typically ending in -il such as: Prinivil, Zesteril, or Lisinopril.

- Adult patient who receive Epinephrine should receive a 12-Lead ECG at some point during their care, but this should NOT delay the administration of Epinephrine.

- Generally, the shorter the time is from contact with an allergen to the onset of symptoms, the more severe the reaction.

- **Epinephrine may precipitate cardiac ischemia. The following patients should receive half the adult dose of Epinephrine (0.15mg Epinephrine 1 mg/ 1ml) or EMTs use an EpiPen Junior for the initial dose and any repeated doses for:**
  - Patients with a history of coronary artery disease, MI, stents, CHF, cardiac surgery; OR
  - Patients over 50 years of age.
