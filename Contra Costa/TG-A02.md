## Treatment Protocol

### Initial Assessment

**Spinal motion restriction if indicated**

### Airway Patency

**Airway patent?**

#### If No:
1. **Open airway chin lift/jaw thrust**

2. **Airway foreign body obstruction procedure**
   - **Complete obstruction?**
     - If Yes:
       - **Abdominal thrusts (conscious)**
       - **Chest compression (unconscious)**
       - **Direct laryngoscopy**
     - If No: Continue with protocol

3. **Reassess airway procedure and adjust if necessary**

### Ventilatory Support Assessment

**Ventilatory support required?**

#### If No:
- **Exit to appropriate TG**

#### If Yes:

1. **Supplemental Oxygen via BVM**
   - Goal to maintain Oxygen Saturation ≥ 94%

2. **BVM effective?**

   **If Yes:**
   - **Supplemental Oxygen via BVM**
   - Goal to maintain Oxygen Saturation ≥ 94%
   - **Continuous Waveform Capnography monitoring (EtCO2)**
   - Transport to closest receiving facility

   **If No:**
   - **As indicated, Intubation or iGel**
   - **The maximum allowed attempts for an advanced airway placement is two (2).**
   - **If an attempt fails, reassess and approach with a different technique.**
   - **Continuous Waveform Capnography monitoring (EtCO2)**
   - **Reassess airway procedure and adjust if necessary**

3. **Consider sedation if i-Gel or ETT in place**
   - Midazolam 2-5 mg IV/IO
   - Maximum 5 mg total

4. **Transport to closest receiving facility**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Cormack-Lehane Difficult Airway Assessment

### Grade I
- Complete view of glottic opening and surrounding structures

### Grade II
- Partial view of the glottic opening

### Grade III
- Only the epiglottis is visible
- **Use I-Gel**

### Grade IV
- No distinguishable anatomy is visible

## Pearls

- **Always weigh the risks and benefits of endotracheal intubation in the field against transport.** All prehospital endotracheal intubations are considered high risk. If ventilation/oxygenation is adequate, transport may be the best and safest option. The most important airway device is the BVM, not the laryngoscope.

- If an effective airway is being maintained with a BVM and a basic airway adjunct with continuous pulse oximetry values of ≥ 90% or values expected based on pathophysiologic condition with otherwise reassuring vital sign (e.g. pulse oximetry of 85% with otherwise normal vital signs in a post-drowning patient), it is acceptable to continue with basic airway measures rather than placing an advanced airway.

- For the purposes of this TG, a secure airway is achieved when the patient is receiving appropriate oxygenation and ventilation.

- An intubation attempt is defined as inserting the laryngoscope blade with the intent to intubate or inserting an advanced airway past the teeth.

- An appropriate ventilatory rate is one that maintains an EtCO2 of 35 or greater. Avoid hyperventilation.

- A Bougie is strongly encouraged for all ET intubation attempts.

- Effective use of a BVM is best achieved with two (2) people.

- The airway should be reassessed with each patient move. Document findings and EtCO2 readings for each.

- Maintain spinal motion restriction for patients with suspected spinal injury.

- Document visualization and grading scale in prehospital record.

- Hyperventilation in deteriorating head trauma should only be done to maintain an EtCO2 of 30-35.

- It is important to secure the advanced airway well and consider c-collar use (in the absence of trauma) to better maintain advanced airway placement. Manual stabilization of advanced airway should be used during all patient moves/transfers.

- **Trauma:** Utilize in-line cervical stabilization during intubation, BLS airway or BVM use. During intubation, the cervical collar front should be open or removed to facilitate translation of the mandible/mouth opening.
