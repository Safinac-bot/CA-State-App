## History

- Medications (e.g. Aminophylline, Adderall, diet pills, thyroid supplements, decongestants, and Digoxin)
- Diet
- Drugs (e.g. nicotine and illegal drugs)
- Past medical history
- History of palpations/heart racing
- Syncope/near syncope

## Differential

- Dysrhythmia
- Sick sinus syndrome
- Myocardial infarction
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Exertion, pain, or emotional stress
- Fever/sepsis
- Hypoxia
- Hypovolemia or anemia
- Drug effect/overdose (see History)
- Hyperthyroidism
- Pulmonary embolus

## Signs and Symptoms

- Hypotension
- Palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or diaphoresis
- CHF
- **Potential presenting rhythm:**
  - Atrial/sinus tachycardia
  - Atrial fibrillation/flutter
  - Multifocal atrial tachycardia
  - Ventricular tachycardia

## Treatment Protocol

### Cardiac Monitor

### 12-Lead ECG or Rhythm Strip

### Patient Stability Assessment

**Is the patient unstable due to Tachycardia?**

#### Unstable due to Tachycardia

**Criteria for instability:**
- HR typically >150
- Hypotension/shock often with signs of poor perfusion
- Altered mental status
- Chest pain highly suggestive of ACS:
  - Severe crushing chest pain
  - Pale/diaphoretic
  - With or without evidence of ischemia on ECG (STEMI, T-wave inversion/depression)

**If Unstable:**

1. **Establish IV/IO**

2. **Consider sedation pre-cardioversion**
   - Midazolam 1mg IV/IO
   - May repeat if needed in 1-2mg increments
   - Maximum 5mg

3. **Immediate Synchronized Cardioversion**
   - Narrow Regular: 100J, 150J, 200J…
   - Narrow Irregular: 150J, 200J, 300J…
   - Wide Regular: 150J, 200J, 300J…
   - Wide Irregular: Defibrillate 360J
   - **If any delay in synchronized cardioversion and the patient is critical, defibrillate 360J**

4. **Contact Base Hospital for further direction if recurrent or resistant to initial three (3) shocks**

5. **If rhythm change, repeat 12-Lead ECG**

#### Stable Patient

**Narrow or Wide QRS?**

##### NARROW QRS

**Regular rhythm?**

**If Regular (e.g. SVT):**
1. **Vagal maneuver**

2. **Establish IV/IO**

3. **Adenosine 6mg IV/IO rapid push**
   - Follow with 20 ml NS rapid flush
   - May repeat 12mg IV/IO

4. **12-Lead ECG or repeat if rhythm change**

5. **Monitor for recurrence**

**If Irregular (e.g. A-fib/A-flutter):**
1. **12-Lead ECG or repeat if rhythm change**

2. **Look for and treat underlying conditions (e.g. dehydration, CHF exacerbation)**

3. **Monitor and reassess**
   - If patient becomes unstable, go to appropriate arm

##### WIDE QRS

**Regular rhythm?**

**If Regular:**
1. **Establish IV/IO**

2. **If symptomatic, consider Amiodarone 150mg IV/IO drip over 10 minutes**
   - May repeat x 1 dose if needed

3. **12-Lead ECG or repeat if rhythm change**

4. **Monitor and reassess**
   - If patient becomes unstable, go to appropriate arm

**If Irregular:**
1. **Establish IV/IO**

2. **If symptomatic, consider Amiodarone 150mg IV/IO drip over 10 minutes**
   - May repeat x 1 dose if needed

3. **12-Lead ECG or repeat if rhythm change**

4. **Monitor and reassess**
   - If patient becomes unstable, go to appropriate arm

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- In unstable patients with fever or other signs of sepsis, the underlying cause of the rapid heart rate is more likely fever and hypovolemia. This is particularly true in wide irregular tachycardia which is frequently underlying A fib with a bundle branch block. Initial efforts should focus on treating appropriately for underlying sepsis.

- If at any point the patient becomes unstable, move to the unstable arm of the algorithm.

- For ASYMPTOMATIC patients (or those with only minimal symptom, such as palpitations) and any tachycardia with a rate of approximately 100-120 with a normal blood pressure, consider CLOSE OBSERVATION or fluid bolus rather than immediate treatment with an anti-arrhythmic medication.

- If patient has a history or if 12 lead ECG reveals Wolfe Parkinson White (WPW), use caution with Adenosine and give only with a defibrillator immediately available.

- In Polymorphic VT: torsade de pointes, etc., the variation in QRS morphology may make it difficult to synchronize. If you cannot synchronize, move to defibrillation.

- In Wide IRREGULAR rhythm such as AFib with left or right bundle, etc, synchronize cardioversion at 360J is more likely to yield first shock conversion.

- Symptomatic tachycardia usually occurs at rates of 120-150 and typically >150 beats per minute. Patients who are symptomatic with heart rates <150 likely have impaired cardiac function, such as CHF.

- Search for underlying cause of tachycardia such as fever, sepsis, dehydration, hypovolemia, etc.

- Monitor for respiratory depression and hypotension associated with Midazolam.

- **Providers must export ALL MONITOR DATA to EHR when caring for and treating tachycardia patients.**
