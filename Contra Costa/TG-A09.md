**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective Date:** January 2023  
**Page:** 1 of 2

---

## History

- Asthma; COPD – chronic bronchitis and emphysema
- Home treatment (e.g. oxygen or nebulizer)
- Medications (e.g. Theophylline, steroids, inhalers, digoxin, lasix, Viagra, Sildenafil, levitra, vardenafil, cialis, or tadalafil)
- Toxic exposure or smoke inhalation
- Cardiac History including MI

## Differential

- Asthma
- COPD
- Congestive Heart Failure
- Myocardial Infarction
- Aspiration
- Pneumonia
- Pulmonary embolus
- Hyperventilation
- Inhaled toxin

## Signs and Symptoms

- Shortness of breath
- Increased respiratory rate and effort
- Diminished or abnormal lung sounds (e.g wheezes, rales, or crackles)
- Tachycardia
- Pursed lip breathing
- Use of accessory muscles
- Jugular vein distension
- Peripheral edema or diaphoresis
- Pink, frothy sputum

## Treatment Protocol

### Oxygen

- Titrate to SpO2 ≥ 94%

### Cardiac Monitor

### EtCO2 Monitoring

### Consider 12-Lead ECG if STEMI Suspected

### Airway Assessment

**Airway Obstructed or ventilatory support required?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Adult Airway TG**
- **Consider assisted ventilations via BVM for respiratory failure**
- **Consider advanced airway if BVM is ineffective**

**If No:**
- Continue with treatment below

### Allergic Reaction Assessment

**Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis TG**

**If No:**
- Continue with treatment below

### Consider IV/IO

### History, Signs and Symptoms Assessment

#### ASTHMA/COPD/BRONCHOSPASM SUSPECTED

1. **Albuterol nebulizer 5 mg**
   - Repeat as needed

2. **Consider CPAP for moderate to severe distress**

3. **For severe respiratory distress or suspected impending respiratory failure, consider:**
   - **Epinephrine (1 mg/ml) 0.3 mg IM**
   - (Use 0.15 mg for patients > 50 years of age or HR ≥ 150)

---

#### CHF/PULMONARY EDEMA SUSPECTED

1. **Consider CPAP for moderate to severe distress**

2. **SBP > 90?**

   **If Yes:**
   - **Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual**
     - If systolic BP > 150, double Nitroglycerin to 0.8 mg sublingual
     - Repeat every 5 minutes as needed

   **If No:**
   - **Consider exit to Hypotension/Shock TG**

### Treatment Effectiveness

**Treatment effective?**

**If No:**
- Reassess and consider alternative treatments or additional doses

**If Yes:**
- Continue monitoring and transport

### Routine Care

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Patients receiving Epinephrine should receive a 12-Lead ECG at some point in their care in the prehospital setting, but this should NOT delay the administration of Epinephrine.

- A silent chest (the absence of lung sounds) in respiratory distress is a severe sign.

- For patients who do not tolerate CPAP or for whom it is contraindicated, consider BVM ventilation.

- Avoid Nitroglycerin in any patient who has used Viagra (Sildenafil) or Levitra (Vardenafil) in the past 24 hours or Cialis (Tadalafil) in the past 36 hours due to potential for severe hypotension.

- If a patient has taken their own Nitroglycerin without relief, consider potency of medication. Provider maximum doses do not include patient administered doses.

- Diabetic, geriatric, and female patients with ACS or hx of MI often have atypical symptoms (e.g. shortness of breath alone) and cardiac ischemia should be considered.

- **Epinephrine may precipitate cardiac ischemia. The following patients should receive half the adult dose of Epinephrine (0.15mg Epinephrine 1mg/ml) for the initial dose and any repeated doses:**
  1. Patients with a history of coronary artery disease, MI, stents, CHF, cardiac surgery; OR
  2. Patients over 50 years of age; OR
  3. Patient has a heart rate ≥ 150.

- Pulse oximetry and continuous EtCO2 monitoring is required for all respiratory patients.

- Document CPAP application using the CPAP procedure in the EHR. Document the 12-Lead ECG in the EHR as a procedure along with the interpretation.
