# Multi-System Trauma

**Treatment Guideline T06**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2025

---

## History

- Time of injury
- Mechanism (blunt vs. penetrating)
- Damage to structure or vehicle
- Location of patient in structure or vehicle
- Restraints or protective equipment use
- Past medical history
- Medications

---

## Differential

**Chest:**
- Tension pneumothorax
- Flail chest
- Pericardial tamponade
- Open chest wound
- Hemothorax

**Other:**
- Intra-abdominal bleeding
- Pelvis or femur fracture
- Spinal injury
- Head injury
- Hypothermia

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- Evidence of trauma
- Pain, swelling, deformity, lesions, or bleeding
- ALOC
- Unconscious
- Respiratory distress or failure
- Hypotension or shock
- Arrest

---

## Treatment

### E - Control external hemorrhage

### E - Secure airway and support ventilation

### E - Consider SMR

### P - Cardiac monitor

### P - EtCO2 monitoring

### P - Establish IV/IO

### E - Assess and stabilize injuries

### E - Early transport
**Limit scene time to 10 minutes for critical patients**

### P - If indicated, perform needle decompression (FP16)

### Do not delay transport

## Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock

| Age Group | Hypotension |
|-----------|-------------|
| Neonate | < 60 mmHg or weak pulses |
| Infant | < 70 mmHg or weak pulses |
| 1-10 years | < 70 mmHg + (age in years x2) |
| Over 10 years | < 90 mmHg |

## Exit Points

- Consider Exit to Major Hemorrhage Control TG
- Consider Exit to Head Trauma TG
- Reference T01 Trauma Triage Criteria

## Notification

Notify receiving facility. Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.

## Pearls

- ALS procedures in the field do not significantly improve patient outcome in critical trauma patients.
- Do not overlook the possibility of associated domestic violence or child/elder abuse.
- Basic airway management is preferred unless unable to effectively manage with BLS maneuvers. Utilize jaw thrust technique to open the airway. An advanced airway should not be used in traumatic arrest.
- In cases of clear-cut traumatic arrest, Epinephrine is not indicated in PEA or asystole. Epinephrine will not correct arrest caused by a tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or hemorrhagic shock. If there is any doubt as to the cause of arrest, treat as a non-traumatic arrest.
- Assessment of baseline GCS is critical for patient care. Aggressively monitor and assess for changes by repeat examination.
- Hypotension is age dependent. This is not always reliable and should be interpreted in context with the patient's typical BP, if known. Shock may be present with a seemingly normal blood pressure initially. Hypotension usually indicates injury or shock and should be treated aggressively.
