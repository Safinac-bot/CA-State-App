### Blood Glucose Analysis

- **Possible medical cause of behavioral change:**
  - Exit to Altered Mental Status TG
  - Exit to Diabetic TG
  - Exit to Overdose/Toxic Ingestion TG
  - Exit to Head Trauma TG

### Cardiac Monitor

### Consider IV

### Assess Patient's Level of Agitation

#### MILD
**Anxious/agitated but cooperative**
- Not aggressive (verbally or physically)
- Has the potential to be easily provoked or triggered

**Treatment:**
- Monitor and reassess

---

#### MODERATE
**Verbally confrontational**
- Uncooperative
- Easily provoked or triggered
- Threatening physical posture (clenched jaw, fists)
- Not physically combative
- Disruptive without danger

**Treatment:**
- Consider restraints

---

#### SEVERE
**Overtly confrontational**
- Physically combative (fighting, spitting, biting)
- Has little control
- Not easily directed
- Not able to be de-escalated
- Extremely aggressive or violent

**Treatment:**

  - **OR**
- **Midazolam 1-3mg IV in 1mg increments**

**Age ≥ 65 years of age:**
- 1mg IV/IM
- May repeat every 5 minutes to effect

**Monitor SpO2 and EtCO2**

---

#### SEVERE AGITATION WITH AMS

**Poses immediate and grave danger to self or providers and exhibits the following:**
- Possibly confused or incoherent
- Unable to maintain attention
- Significantly increased strength
- Impervious to pain or fatigue
- Diaphoresis
- Hot/flushed skin
- Tachycardia

**\*\* Patients are often found in a protracted physical struggle requiring physical restraint by multiple providers.**

**Treatment:**

**Reassess prior to administration**

1. **If patient is hot to touch or suspected hyperthermia, initiate cooling measures**

2. **Midazolam 10mg IM**
   - Maximum 10mg

3. **Contact Base Hospital Physician for additional order**

4. **Monitor SpO2 and EtCO2**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Severe Agitation with Altered Mental Status

**This is a medical emergency.** The condition is a combination of delirium, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, speech disturbances, disorientation, violent/bizarre behavior, insensitivity to pain, hyperthermia and increased strength. The condition is life-threatening and is often associated with use of physical control measures, including physical restraints, and tasers. Most commonly seen in male patients with a history of serious mental illness or drug abuse, particularly stimulant drugs such as cocaine, crack cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamines, bath salts, or similar agents. Alcohol withdrawal or head injury may also contribute to the condition.

## Pearls

- **Crew/responder safety is the main priority.** See Policy 1008 – Managing Assaultive Behavior/Patient Restraint. Consider all possible medical/trauma causes for behavior (e.g. hypoglycemia, overdose, substance abuse, hypoxia, seizure, head injury, etc.).

- Do not overlook the possibility of associated domestic violence or child abuse.

- If patient suspected of severe agitation with altered mental status and suffers cardiac arrest, consider fluid bolus and sodium bicarbonate early.

- Do not irritate the patient with a prolonged exam. Be thorough but quick.

- Use least restrictive method needed to manage patient and to ensure safety.

- If restrained, the extremities that are restrained will have a circulation check at least every 15 minutes. The first of these checks should occur as soon after placement of the restraints as possible. This shall be documented in the EHR.

- All patients who receive either physical restraint or chemical sedation must be continuously observed by EMS personnel. This includes direct visualization of the patient as well as cardiac, pulse oximetry and end tidal CO2 monitoring.

- Do not position or transport any restrained patient in a way that negatively affects the patient's respiratory or circulatory status (e.g. hog-tied or prone positions). Do not place backboards, splints or other devices on top of the patient.

- Use caution when administering Midazolam for postictal patients or patients with alcohol intoxication. Apply waveform capnography and frequently assess for depressed respirations and level of consciousness.
