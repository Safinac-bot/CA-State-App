- Past medical history
- Medications
- Existence of terminal illness
- Airway obstruction
- Hypothermia
- Suspected abuse (shaken baby syndrome, pattern of injuries)
- SIDS

## Differential

- Trauma
- Tension pneumothorax
- Toxin or medication
- Acidosis
- Hyperkalemia
- Hypoglycemia

## Signs and Symptoms

- Apneic
- Pulseless

## Treatment Protocol

**Enter from Pediatric Cardiac Arrest TG**

### Continue Ventilation via BVM

**With appropriate compression/ventilatory ratio**
- **Avoid hyperventilation**

### Assess for Reversible Causes and Treat Appropriately

**Reversible Causes:**
- Hypovolemia
- Hypoxia
- Hydrogen ion (acidosis)
- Hypothermia
- Hypo/Hyperkalemia
- Hypoglycemia
- Tension pneumothorax
- Tamponade (cardiac)
- Toxins
- Thrombosis (pulmonary)(PE)
- Thrombosis (coronary)(MI)

### Establish IV/IO

### Epinephrine Administration

**Epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml) IO/IV**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
- Repeat every 4 minutes
- 1st dose ASAP – preferably within 5 minutes from initiation of CPR

**Do not interrupt Chest Compressions to administer medications**

### Resume Chest Compressions

- Push hard (Infant - 1.5" / Children - 2") and fast (100-120/min)
- Change compressors every 2 minutes (Limit changes / pulse checks to < 5 seconds)

### Fluid Resuscitation

**Normal saline fluid bolus IO/IV**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

### Rhythm Assessment

**Shockable rhythm?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Peds Vfib/Pulseless V-Tach**

**If No:**
- Continue treatment

### ROSC Assessment

**ROSC?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Peds ROSC**

**If No:**
- Continue resuscitation

### Termination of Resuscitation

**Meets criteria for transport?**

**If No:**
- **Discontinue Resuscitation**
- Follow Policy 1004.V.A.5 – Termination of Resuscitation

**If Yes:**
- Continue treatment and transport

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Patients with a rapid pulseless rate are most likely hypovolemic. Fluid will likely reverse this condition.

- In order to be successful in pediatric arrests, a cause must be identified and corrected.

- Respiratory arrest is a common case of cardiac arrest. Unlike adults, early airway intervention is critical.

- In most cases, pediatric airways can be maintained with basic interventions.
