# Trauma Triage

**Treatment Guideline T01**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2025

---

## Trauma Triage Decision Tree

### Injury incompatible with life or traumatic arrest (unwitnessed by EMS) with confirmed asystole or PEA

**→ Do not begin resuscitation. Follow Policy 1004.**

---

### Unmanageable airway

**→ Transport to closest facility**

---

### Traumatic arrest that does not meet Determination of Death criteria

**→ Follow Policy Section III – Traumatic Arrest**

---

## Trauma Activate Criteria

Transport to designated trauma center unless trauma center is > 20 minutes, then transport to closest facility.

### Mental Status & Vital Sign Criteria

- GCS ≤ 13
- RR < 10 or > 29
- Respiratory distress or need for respiratory support
- Room air SpO2 < 90%

**Age-Specific Blood Pressure Criteria:**
- **Age 0-9:** SBP < 70 + (2x age in years)
- **Age 10-64:** SBP < 90 or HR > SBP
- **Age ≥ 65:** SBP < 110 or HR > SBP

---

### Injury Pattern Criteria

- All penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso, or proximal extremities
- Skull deformity or suspected skull fracture
- Suspected spinal injury with new motor or sensory loss
- Chest wall instability, deformity or suspected flail chest
- Suspected pelvic fracture
- Suspected fracture of two or more proximal long bones
- Crushed, degloved, mangled, or pulseless extremity
- Amputation above the wrist or ankle
- Uncontrolled bleeding requiring a tourniquet or hemostatic gauze

---

### Mechanism of Injury Criteria

**High risk auto crash:**
- Partial or complete ejection
- Significant passenger compartment intrusion
- Roof intrusion
  - \> 12" occupant site or
  - \>18" any site or
- Extrication of entrapped patient
- Death in same passenger compartment
- Child (age 0-9yrs) unrestrained or in unsecured child safety seat

**Other mechanisms:**
- MVA > 40 mph
- Rollover with unrestrained occupant
- Fall from height > 10ft (all ages)
- Auto vs. pedestrian/bicyclist thrown, run over, or with significant impact > 20 mph
- Rider ejected (e.g. motorcycle, ATV, electric bicycle, horse, etc) > 20 mph
- Significant injury from blunt assault with weapon (e.g. pipe, bat, golf club, etc)

---

### EMS Judgment

- Low level falls (age ≤ 5yrs) or older adults (≥ 65yrs) w/significant head impact
- Anticoagulant use with evidence of trauma
- Suspicion of child abuse
- Special, high-resource healthcare needs
- Pregnancy >20 weeks
- Burns in conjunction with trauma

---

## Base Hospital Contact Required

Consider base contact for destination decision.

---

## Age Categories

- **Adult trauma patients:** ≥ 15 years
- **Pediatric trauma patients:** ≤ 14 years

---

## Trauma Receiving Facilities

### Adult Trauma Centers

John Muir Medical Center – Walnut Creek is the designated trauma center for adults in Contra Costa County. In some circumstances, patients may be transported to other trauma centers. Alameda County Medical Center (Highland) and Eden Medical Center are trauma centers that, when they are the closest trauma center, may be appropriate for ground transport of trauma patients.

### Pediatric Trauma Centers

UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital of Oakland (CHO) is the most appropriate destination for the majority of pediatric trauma patients. UC Davis Medical Center is also a pediatric trauma center and may be utilized with helicopter transport. John Muir Medical Center – Walnut Creek may be an appropriate trauma center for critically injured pediatric trauma patients when risks of prolonged transport to the designated pediatric trauma center outweigh the benefits.

### Receiving Facilities

Local hospitals are receiving facilities for patients who are triaged by the Base Hospital at the time of report as not requiring trauma center care. A trauma center may also serve as the receiving facility when it is the patient's facility of choice.

---

## Trauma Reiterations

### Unmanageable Airway

A trauma patient whose airway is unable to be adequately maintained with BLS or ALS maneuvers should be transported to the closest facility. Following airway stabilization at a non-trauma center ED, these patients are candidates for immediate retriage to the trauma center.

### Traumatic Arrest

Patients in traumatic arrest that do not meet the Determination of Death criteria should be trauma activated, unless trauma center is > 20 minutes away. Otherwise, these patients should be transported to the closest facility.

### Helicopter Usage

If a helicopter crew is present at the time of arrest (blunt or penetrating) and the air transport can be initiated immediately, use of helicopter to transport to a trauma center would be appropriate if it provides a significant advantage over ground transport in terms of timely delivery of the patient.

---

## Pearls

- Intoxicated patients may have unrecognized injuries, particularly head bleeds.
- A complete hands-on head-to-toe assessment is indicated for all trauma patients.
- Transport should be initiated within 10 minutes of ambulance arrival unless patient requires extrication.

### EMS Judgement and Considerations:

Low energy mechanism trauma may reveal significant trauma. Examples include, but are not limited to, ground level or short falls, blunt assault without a weapon (e.g., closed fist), low speed motor vehicle crash, or other blunt trauma (e.g., sports injury). Symptoms or concern may include:

- Symptoms in the presence of head injury such as headache, vomiting, loss of consciousness, repetitive questioning, abnormal, combative behavior or new onset of confusion.
- Pain level greater than 5/10 related to head, neck, or torso injury.
- Any concerns due to hypotension, tachycardia, or tachypnea.
- SBP < 110 in patients ≥ 65 years.
- Torso injury with tenderness of abdomen, chest/ribs, or back/flank.
- Suspected hip dislocation or pelvis injury.
