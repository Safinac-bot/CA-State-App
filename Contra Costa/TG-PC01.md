## History

- Code status (DNR or POLST)
- Events leading to arrest
- Estimated downtime
- Prior resuscitation attempts
- Past medical history
- Medications
- Existence of terminal illness
- Suspected physical abuse

## Differential

- Respiratory failure (foreign body, secretions, infection)
- Hypovolemia (dehydration)
- Congenital heart disease
- Trauma
- Hypothermia
- Tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or PE
- Toxin or medication
- Electrolyte abnormalities (glucose, potassium)
- Acidosis

## Signs and Symptoms

- Unresponsive
- Apneic
- Pulseless

## Treatment Protocol

### Criteria for Death/No Resuscitation

**Review DNR/POLST form**

**Criteria:**
- Decomposition
- Rigor mortis
- Dependent lividity
- Injury incompatible with life or traumatic arrest with asystole

**If above criteria met:** Do not begin resuscitation. Follow Policy 1004 â€“ Determination of Death

### Age Assessment

**Newly born <31 days old?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Newly Born TG**

**If No:**
- Continue with pediatric cardiac arrest protocol

### Cardiac Monitor

### Apply AED if Available

### EtCO2 Monitoring

### Begin Chest Compressions

**CPR Ratios:**
- **Children 1 month to 8 years:** Use 15:2
- **Children over 8 years:** Use 30:2
- **Newly born (<31 days):** Use 3:1

**Compression Technique:**
- Push hard (1.5 inches Infant / 2 inches Children) and fast (100-120/min)
- Use metronome to ensure proper rate
- Change compressors every 2 minutes (Limit changes/pulse checks to < 5 seconds)

### Basic Airway Procedure

### ALS Available?

**If No:**
- **Continue CPR**
- 5 cycles over 2 minutes
- Repeat and assess

**If Yes:**
- Continue to rhythm assessment

### Rhythm Assessment

**Shockable rhythm?**

#### If Shockable (VF/VT):

1. **Automated defibrillation**

2. **Continue CPR**
   - 5 cycles over 2 minutes
   - Repeat and assess

3. **Shockable rhythm persists?**
   - If Yes: **Exit to Pediatric VF/VT**
   - If No: Reassess rhythm

#### If Non-Shockable (Asystole/PEA):

1. **Continue CPR**
   - 5 cycles over 2 minutes
   - Repeat and assess

2. **Exit to Pediatric Asystole/PEA**

### Return of Spontaneous Circulation

**AT ANY TIME - If Return of Spontaneous Circulation:**
- **Exit to Post ROSC TG**

## Pearls

- Efforts should be directed at high quality chest compressions with limited interruptions and early defibrillation when indicated. Compress 1.5 inches in infants and 2 inches in children. Consider early IO placement if available or direct IV access if anticipated.

- In cases of clear-cut traumatic arrest, epinephrine is not indicated in PEA or asystole. Epinephrine will not correct arrest caused by a tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or hemorrhagic shock. If there is any doubt as to the cause of arrest, treat as a non-traumatic arrest.

- Airway is a more important intervention in pediatric arrests. This should be accomplished quickly with a BVM and appropriately sized mask. Patient survival is often dependent on proper ventilation and oxygenation.

- Resuscitation is based on proper planning and organized execution. Procedures require space and patient access. Make room to work. Utilize team focused approach assigning responders to predetermined tasks.

- Prevent hypothermia by moving to a warm environment and avoid unnecessary exposure.

- DO NOT HYPERVENTILATE.

- Do not delay chest compressions while applying any device or intervention.

- Use a metronome during chest compression to ensure proper rate.
