# Intravenous Vascular Access

**Field Procedure FP-FP23**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2025  
**Applies to:** Paramedic

---

## Clinical Indications

1. Any patient where intravenous access is indicated (significant trauma, emergent, or potentially emergent medical condition) for fluid or medication therapy.

---

## Procedure

1. Saline locks may be used as an alternative to an IV tubing and IV fluid in every treatment guideline at the discretion of the ALS provider.

2. Use the largest catheter necessary based upon the patient's condition and size of veins.

3. **Select the most appropriate site:**
   - **Arm** – General fluid and medications. This is not a preferred site for patients in shock.
   - **Antecubital** – Preferred site for patients in shock, cardiac arrest, who will receive Adenosine, or when a peripheral site is not available.
   - **External Jugular (EJ) Adult Only** – Unstable patients who need emergent IV medications or fluids AND no peripheral site is available AND IO access is not appropriate.

4. Inspect the IV solution for expiration date, cloudiness, discoloration, leaks, or the presence of particles.

5. Connect IV tubing to the solution in a sterile manner. Fill the drip chamber half full and flush the tubing, to remove all air bubbles from the line.

6. Place a tourniquet around the patient's extremity to restrict venous flow only.

7. Prep the skin with chlorhexidine and allow to air dry.

8. Insert the needle with the bevel up into the skin in a steady, deliberate motion until a blood flashback is visualized in the catheter.

9. Advance the catheter into the vein. Never reinsert the needle through the catheter. Dispose of the needle into a sharps container without recapping.

10. Remove the tourniquet and connect the IV tubing or saline lock.

11. Open the IV to assure free flow of the fluid and then adjust the flow rate as clinically indicated.

## Notes

1. Any working venous catheter already accessed prior to EMS arrival may be used for EMS IV fluids and medications.

2. All IV fluid rates should be kept at a minimum rate to keep the vein open (TKO).
