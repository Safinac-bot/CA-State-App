**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2020

---

## History

- Type of bite or sting
- Description or photo of creature for identification, if safe to do so
- Time, location, size of bite or sting
- Previous reaction to bite or sting
- Domestic vs. wild
- Tetanus and Rabies risk
- Immunocompromised patient

---

## Differential

- Animal bite
- Human bite
- Snake bite (poisonous)
- Spider bite (poisonous)
- Insect sting/bite (bee, wasp, ant, or tick)
- Infection risk
- Rabies risk
- Tetanus risk

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- Rash, skin break, or wound
- Pain, soft tissue swelling, or redness
- Blood oozing from the bite wound
- Evidence of infection
- Shortness of breath or wheezing
- Allergic reaction, hives, or itching
- Hypotension or shock

---

## Treatment

### E - If possible identify source of bite

### E - General wound care

### E - Remove all jewelry from affected extremity

### E - Immobilize injury

### E - Elevate wound location to a neutral position, if able

**DO NOT APPLY COLD PACKS** (for snake bites)

## Decision Points

### Uncontrolled Hemorrhage?
**Yes** → Exit to Major Hemorrhage Control TG

### Snake bite?
**Yes:**
- Remove any constricting clothing/bands/jewelry
- Mark margin of swelling/redness and time

### Spider bite or Bee/wasp sting?
**Yes:**
- Consider applying cold pack(s)

### Allergic reaction/Anaphylaxis?
**Yes** → Exit to Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis TG
- Adult TG
- Pediatric TG

### Serious injury or Hypotension?
**Yes** → Exit to Hypotension/Shock TG
- Adult TG
- Pediatric TG

### Moderate/severe Pain?
**Yes** → Exit to Pain Control TG
- Adult TG
- Pediatric TG

## Additional Actions

### P - Consider IV/IO

### If indicated, Exit to Extremity Trauma TG

### Animal bites:
Contact Animal Control 925-646-2441 or Law Enforcement and document contact

## Pearls

- Human bites have higher infection rates than animal bites due to normally occurring mouth bacteria.
- Carnivore bites are much more likely to become infected and may have risk of Rabies exposure.
- Cat bites may progress to infection rapidly due to a specific bacteria (Pasteurella multicoda).
- Poisonous snakes in our region are generally of the pit viper family: six rattlesnake species.
- If no pain or swelling is present, envenomation is unlikely. About 25% of snake bites are dry bites.
- Black Widow spider bites tend to be minimally painful initially, but over a few hours, muscular and severe abdominal pain may develop (black spider with a red hourglass on belly).
- Brown Recluse spider bites are minimally painful to painless. Little reaction is noted initially but tissue necrosis at the site of the bite develops over the next few days (brown spider with fiddle shape on back).
- Evidence of infection includes: swelling, redness, drainage, fever, and red streaks proximal to wound.
- Immunocompromised patients are at an increased risk for infection.
