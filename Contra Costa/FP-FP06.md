## Airway: Supraglottic Airway Devices

**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective Date:** January 2020  
**Applies to:** EMT Optional, Paramedic  
**Page:** 1 of 2

---

## Definitions

1. **Supraglottic Airway Device (SAD):** A device that is placed into the oral pharynx and subsequently placed over the glottic opening. This is done in a 'blind' maneuver without the aid of a laryngoscope. This will aid in the oxygenation and ventilation of the patient.

2. **The I-Gel is the approved supraglottic airway device for Contra Costa County EMS.**

## Indications

1. Cardiac Arrest
2. Respiratory arrest with no immediate reversible cause (i.e. hypoglycemia or opioid overdose)
3. Inability to adequately ventilate a patient with a Bag Valve Mask (BVM) and basic airway adjunct.
4. An unconscious patient without a gag reflex who is apneic or is demonstrating inadequate respiratory effort
5. **For EMT's with approved optional scope:** Patients greater than or equal to 15 years of age in need of airway protection or unable to be adequately ventilated with BVM.

## Contraindications

1. Gag reflex
2. Caustic ingestion – Esophageal burns
3. Known esophageal disease (e.g. cancer, varices or stricture)
4. Laryngectomy with stoma – if present, place ETT in stoma
5. Severe airway trauma
6. Trismus

## Complications

1. Airway and/or esophageal trauma
2. Regurgitation
3. Aspiration

## Procedure

1. Prepare, position and oxygenate the patient with 100% Oxygen.

2. Document the pre-intubation EtCO2 reading.

3. Select proper I-Gel using weight based chart.

4. Lubricate the I-Gel with water-based lubricant, get suction ready.

5. If present, remove dentures or plates from the mouth prior to insertion.

6. Remove the I-Gel cradle and gently press the chin downwards and introduce the iGel into the mouth with the opening towards the chin, along the hard palatte until a definitive resistance is felt. Do not apply excessive force on the I-Gel upon insertion.

7. Attach BVM, EtCO2 and ventilate the patient.

8. Auscultate for breath sounds and sounds over the epigastrium and look for the chest to rise and fall.

9. Confirm tube placement using EtCO2 and waveform capnography.

**It is required that the airway be monitored continuously through waveform capnography (ALS providers) and pulse oximetry.**

10. Secure I-Gel airway to patient with an approved method.
