## Treatment Protocol

### Assess Symptom Severity

**Stable or Unstable (Hypotension/poor perfusion)?**

#### If Stable:

1. **Cardiac monitor**

2. **Signs/symptoms suggesting cardiac etiology?**

   **If Yes:**
   - Consider 12-Lead ECG
   - **Exit to Appropriate Cardiac TG**

   **If No:**
   - Continue with treatment below

3. **Establish IV/IO**

4. **If patient has nausea or vomiting, consider:**
   - **Ondansetron 4mg IV/IO/IM/ODT**
   - May repeat x 1 after 15 minutes

5. **If indicated, exit to Pain Control TG**

#### If Unstable (Hypotension/poor perfusion):

1. **Cardiac monitor**

2. **Establish IV/IO**

3. **Normal Saline bolus 500ml**
   - Repeat as needed
   - Titrate to systolic BP > 90
   - Maximum 1L

4. **Hypotensive, Signs and Symptoms of shock?**

## Pearls

- Diabetic, females, and geriatric patients often have atypical pain, or only generalized complaints. Suspect cardiac etiology in these patients, perform a 12-Lead ECG, and investigate until proven otherwise.

- For chronic abdominal pain, consider non-narcotic pain control.

- Zofran is not indicated or useful for motion sickness.

- Document the mental status and vital signs prior to administration of anti-emetics.

- Abdominal pain in women of childbearing age should be treated as pregnancy-related until proven otherwise.

- An impression of abdominal aneurysm should be considered with severe abdominal or non-traumatic back pain, especially in patients > 50 years of age or patients with shock/poor perfusion.
