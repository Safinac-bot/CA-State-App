**Effective Date:** January 2023  
**Page:** 1 of 1

---

## History

- Past medical history
- Foreign body exposure
- Respiratory distress or arrest
- Apnea
- Possible toxic or poison exposure
- Congenital disease
- Medication (maternal or infant)

## Differential

- **Respiratory failure:**
  - Foreign body
  - Secretions
  - Infection (e.g. croup, epiglottitis)
- Hypovolemia
- Congenital heart disease
- Trauma
- Tension Pneumothorax
- Hypothermia
- Toxin or medication
- Hypoglycemia
- Acidosis

## Signs and Symptoms

- Decreased heart rate
- Delayed capillary refill or cyanosis
- Mottled, cool skin
- Hypotension or arrest
- Altered mental status
- Syncope

## Treatment Protocol

### Newly Born < 31 Days?

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Newly Born TG**

**If No:**
- Continue with pediatric bradycardia protocol

### Supplemental Oxygen

**Supplemental Oxygen with goal of Oxygen saturation ≥ 94% SpO2**

### Cardiac Monitor

### EtCO2 Monitoring

### Is the Patient Stable?

#### Stable:
- **Observe and monitor**

---

#### Unstable due to Bradycardia:

**Criteria:**
- HR < 60 with poor perfusion
- Delayed capillary refill
- Hypotension
- Respiratory distress
- ALOC

**Treatment:**

1. **Supplemental Oxygen with goal of Oxygen saturation ≥ 94% SpO2**

2. **If heart rate remains < 60 with poor perfusion despite oxygenation and ventilation, begin CPR**

3. **Establish IV/IO**

4. **12-Lead ECG**

5. **Consider Atropine IV/IO**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
   - Atropine should be considered only after adequate oxygenation/ventilation has been ensured

6. **Epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml) IV/IO**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
   - Repeat every 3-5 minutes

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- The majority of pediatric bradycardia is due to airway problems.

- Hypoglycemia, severe dehydration and narcotic effects may produce bradycardia.

- Most maternal medications pass through breast milk to the infant.
