# Crush Injury

**Treatment Guideline T04**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2024

---

## History

- Time of injury (entrapment ≥ 1 hours)
- Mechanism (crush)
- Past medical history
- Medications

---

## Differential

- Contusion
- Laceration
- Dislocation
- Fracture
- Amputation

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- Pain, swelling, deformity, or bleeding
- Altered sensation or motor function
- Diminished pulse or capillary refill
- Decreased extremity temperature

---

## Treatment

### E - Secure airway and support respiratory rate

### P - Cardiac monitor

### P - EtCO2 monitoring

### P - Establish IV/IO

### P - Consider pain control
In the absence of head trauma, age-specific hypotension, poor perfusion, or ALOC

---

## Decision Points

### Hemorrhage Controlled?
**No** → Exit to Major Hemorrhage Control TG

### Signs of Crush Injury Syndrome?

**Crush Injury Syndrome Criteria:**
- Significant prolonged compression of lower extremity, pelvis or chest (≥ 1 hour)

**Yes:**

#### Monitor for ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia

**ECG Progression in Hyperkalemia:**
1. Peaked T Waves
2. Flattened or absent P Waves
3. Widened QRS (≥ 0.12) with or without bradycardia
4. Sine-wave
5. Ventricular Fibrillation or Asystole

#### Prior to release of entrapment:

**P** - Calcium Chloride 1gm over 2-3 minutes  
20ml flush IV/IO prior to pushing next med

**P** - Sodium Bicarbonate 50mEq  
20ml flush IV/IO prior to pushing next med

**P** - Albuterol continuous nebulizer 5mg in 6ml to a total of 20 mg

#### After release of entrapment:

**BH** - Contact Base for further treatment direction with ECG changes

## Fluid Resuscitation

### If SBP < 90 in adults
Normal Saline bolus 500ml IV/IO  
May repeat as long as criteria above exists

### Pediatric Patients
Refer to age dependent chart for pediatric Normal Saline bolus IV/IO  
Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide  
May repeat to age dependent goal SBP

**Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock:**
- **Neonate:** < 60mmHg or weak pulses
- **Infant:** < 70mmHg or weak pulses
- **1-10 years:** < 70mmHg + (age in years x2)
- **Over 10 years:** <90mmHg

## Notification

Notify receiving facility. Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.

## Pearls

- A crush injury is sustained from compressive force sufficient to interfere with the normal metabolic function of the involved tissue. It may be open or closed.
- Compartment Syndrome is the local manifestations of muscle ischemia resulting from compressive forces on a closed space.
- Crush Injury Syndrome is a systemic manifestation of trauma and ischemia involving soft tissues, principally skeletal muscle, due to prolonged severe crushing. It leads to increased permeability of the cell membrane and the release of potassium, enzymes, and myoglobin from within cells. Ischemic renal dysfunction secondary to hypotension and diminished renal perfusion results in acute tubular necrosis and uremia.
- Crush Injury Syndrome should be suspected in patients with an extensive area of involvement such as a lower extremity, chest, or pelvis. The syndrome may develop after one hour, but usually takes 4-6 hours. Suspect and monitor for hyperkalemia with extended entrapment.
- Treat small, isolated areas such as a hand or foot as isolated skeletal injuries, not as crush injury syndrome.
- If elderly or cardiac history is present, use caution with fluid administration.
- Mixing Sodium Bicarbonate and Calcium Chloride will create a precipitate in the IV. To avoid this, consider using separate lines or use a normal saline flush between administration of these medications.
