## Treatment Protocol

### Sudden Signs and Symptoms Consistent with Stroke

### Blood Glucose Analysis

**If indicated, exit to Diabetic Emergency TG**

### Perform Cincinnati Stroke Screen

### Last Known Well Time is ≤ 24 hours?

#### If No:
- Monitor and reassess
- Consider IV
- Consider 12-Lead ECG if monitor suggests dysrhythmia
- Cardiac monitor

#### If Yes:

**Positive CINCINNATI STROKE SCREEN?**

**If No (Negative Cincinnati Stroke Screen):**
- Consider other causes
- Cardiac monitor
- Consider 12-Lead ECG if monitor suggests dysrhythmia

**If Yes:**

**Still suspect stroke?**

**If No:**
- Continue monitoring

**If Yes:**

1. **Make STROKE ALERT notification to Stroke Receiving Center**

2. **Establish IV**
   - 20g or larger IV in AC preferred
   - Avoid distal sites

3. **Cardiac monitor**

4. **Consider 12-Lead ECG if monitor suggests dysrhythmia**

5. **INITIATE TRANSPORT to a Stroke Receiving Center**
   - Bring family member or guardian, or collect contact information

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Assessment Matrices

### Cincinnati Stroke Screen

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Facial Droop** | Normal: Symmetrical smile or face<br>Abnormal: Asymmetry |
| **Arm Weakness** | Normal: Both arms move symmetrically<br>Abnormal: Asymmetrical arm movement |
| **Speech Abnormality** | Normal: Correct words; no slurring<br>Abnormal: Slurred or incorrect words |

---

### LAMS Assessment

| Finding | Interpretation | Scoring |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Facial Droop** | Normal: Symmetrical smile or face<br>Abnormal: Asymmetry | Absent - 0 points<br>Present - 1 point |
| **Arm Weakness** | Normal: Both arms move symmetrically<br>Abnormal: Asymmetrical arm movement<br>Falls rapidly: some or no effort | Absent - 0 points<br>Drifts - 1 point<br>Falls rapidly - 2 points |
| **Grip** | Normal: Equal grip in both hands<br>Weak: Unequal grip in one hand<br>No grip: no muscle strength or contraction | Normal - 0 points<br>Weak - 1 point<br>No grip - 2 points |

**A LAMS score of ≥ 4 indicates a high likelihood of a LVO stroke**

## Stroke Alert

**A Stroke Alert is indicated when any finding on the Cincinnati Stoke Screen is positive and the Last Known Well Time is less than or equal to 24 hours from patient contact.**

In order for receiving centers to make rapid treatment and potential transfer decisions please include the following in your Stroke Alert report:

- Last Known Well Time as a clock time not as a duration
- Cincinnati Stroke Screen findings
- Vital signs
- Blood glucose result
- Known anticoagulant prescription
- Medical record number (if available) or name and birthdate
- ETA

---

## Pearls

- **Last Known Well Time (LKWT)** is the time the patient was last witnessed to be at their baseline and is the most pertinent patient history detail for a stroke patient that prehospital providers can obtain. Be precise in gathering this, and report it as an actual time (e.g. 13:45 NOT "about 45 minutes ago"). Without this information, patients may not be able to receive thrombolytics at the hospital.

- The time the patient is found with their stroke symptoms (Time of Discovery) is often different than and should be distinguished from the LKWT. The Time of Discovery can also be reported but is secondary to the LKWT.

- Please refrain from Terminology like "time of onset" since this is often not known as strokes are seldom witnessed.

- Patients who have a normal mental status and can communicate effectively, may serve as their own historians.

- Hypoglycemia can present as a LOCALIZED neurologic deficit, especially in the elderly.

- Because the patient may need to receive thrombolytic therapy, avoid multiple IV attempts.

- Avoid distal placement of IVs, if possible, as this is a preferred access site by Interventionalists.

- A 35° head position is preferred for transport.

- When turning over patient care to hospital staff, make sure to include common anticoagulants taken by the patient. Known use of these medications may affect the course of hospital treatment:
  - Warfarin (Coumadin)
  - Enoxaparin (Lovenox)
  - Apixaban (Eliquis)
  - Heparin
  - Dabigatran (Pradaxa)
  - Fondaparinux (Arixtra)
  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)

- 20%-25% of strokes involve the posterior circulation and are not captured by the Cincinnati Stroke Assessment. Symptoms can include the sudden onset of dizziness/vertigo, imbalance/unsteady gait, or vision loss.
