**Treatment Guideline T07**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2020

---

## History

- Exposure to increased temperatures, humidity, or extreme physical exertion
- Time and length of exposure
- Fatigue or muscle cramping
- Poor oral intake of fluids
- Past medical history
- Medications

---

## Differential

- Fever
- Dehydration
- Delirium tremens (DTs)
- Heat cramps
- Heat exhaustion
- Heat stroke

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- ALOC
- Hot, dry, or sweaty skin
- Hypotension or shock
- Seizures
- Nausea

---

## Treatment

### E - Remove from heat source to cool environment

### E - Remove tight clothing

### E - Apply active cooling measures

### P - Cardiac monitor

### P - Establish IV/IO

---

## Temperature Monitoring

- Check an initial temperature and repeat every 15 minutes while actively cooling.
- Obtain and document the patient temperature and location taken.

---

## Fluid Resuscitation

### If SBP < 90 in adults
Normal Saline bolus 500ml IV/IO  
May repeat as long as criteria above exists

### If poor perfusion or shock in Pediatrics (Refer to age dependent chart)
Normal Saline bolus IV/IO  
Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide  
May repeat to age dependent goal SBP

---

## Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock

- **Neonate:** < 60mmHg or weak pulses
- **Infant:** < 70mmHg or weak pulses
- **1-10 years:** < 70mmHg + (age in years x2)
- **Over 10 years:** <90mmHg

## Notification

Notify receiving facility. Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.

## Pearls

- The young and elderly are more prone to heat emergencies.
- Salicylates and some recreational drugs may elevate body temperature.
- Sweating generally disappears as body temperature rises above 104Â°F.
- Intense shivering may occur as a patient is cooled.
- Seizures may occur with heat stroke; treat seizures per seizure treatment guideline.
- Increasing symptoms merit more aggressive cooling measures. With mild symptoms of heat exhaustion, movement to a cooler environment and fanning may suffice.
