## History

- Blood loss
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Fever
- Infection

## Differential

- Shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, septic, neurogenic, or anaphylaxis)
- Trauma
- Infection
- Dehydration
- Congenital heart disease
- Medication or Toxin

## Signs and Symptoms

- Restlessness or confusion
- Weakness or dizziness
- Weak, rapid pulse
- Pale, cool, clammy skin signs
- Delayed capillary refill
- Hypotension
- Tarry stools

## Treatment Protocol

### Oxygen via Blow By or Normal Mask

**Oxygen via blow by or normal mask with goal of Oxygen saturation ≥ 94% SpO2**

### Cardiac Monitor

### If Indicated, Exit to Airway TG

### Anaphylaxis Assessment

**Anaphylaxis?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis TG**

### Trauma Assessment

**Was trauma involved?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Major Hemorrhage Control TG**

### History, Exam and Circumstances Assessment

**History, exam and circumstances often suggest the type of shock**

### Types of Shock:

- Hypovolemic (dehydration or GI bleed)
- Cardiogenic (congenital heart failure)
- Obstructive (PE or cardiac tamponade)
- Distributive (sepsis, anaphylaxis)

### IV/IO Procedure

### Fluid Resuscitation

**With clear lung sounds:**

**Normal Saline bolus IV/IO**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
- Repeat to age dependent goal SBP
- Maximum 1L

**Contact Base Hospital Physician for additional order**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Systemic BP Goals - Pediatric Hypotension

| Age | Goal SBP | Hypotension |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Neonate** | > 60 mmHg | < 60 mmHg or weak pulses |
| **Infant** | > 70 mmHg | < 70 mmHg or weak pulses |
| **1-10 years** | > 70 mmHg + (age in years x2) | < 70 mmHg + (age in years x2) |
| **Over 10 years** | > 90 mmHg | < 90 mmHg |

## Pearls

- Hypotension is age dependent. This is not always reliable and should be interpreted in context with the patient's typical BP, if known. Shock may be present with a seemingly normal blood pressure.

- Normal blood pressure, delayed capillary refill, diminished peripheral pulses, and tachycardia indicates compensated shock in children.

- Hypotension and delayed capillary refill > 4 seconds indicates impending circulatory failure.

- Systolic blood pressure in children may not drop until the patient is 25-30% volume depleted. This may occur through dehydration, blood loss, or an increase in vascular capacity (e.g. anaphylaxis).

- Decompensated shock (hypotension with capillary refill > 5 seconds) may present as PEA in children.

- Sinus tachycardia is the most common cardiac rhythm in encountered in children.

- SVT should be suspected if the heart rate is > 180 in children ages (1-8) or > 220 in infants.

- Hypoglycemia may be found in pediatric shock, especially in infants.

- Pediatric shock victims are at risk for hypothermia due to their increased body surface area, exposure, and rapid administration of IV/IO fluids.

### Common Pediatric Terms:

- **Newly born** are ≤ 24 hours old
- **Neonates** are ≤ 28 days old
- **Infants** are ≤ 1 year old
