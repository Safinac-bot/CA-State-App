## Treatment Protocol

### Loosen Any Constrictive Clothing

### Assess and Manage ABCs

**Initiate BVM ventilation for apnea or ongoing hypoxia**

### Oxygen

- Titrate to SpO2 ≥ 94%

### Cardiac Monitor

### If Indicated, Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR)

### Manage Any Traumatic Injuries

### Blood Glucose (BGL) Analysis

**BGL ≤ 60mg/dl?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Diabetic Emergency TG**

## Status Epilepticus Definition

**Status Epilepticus:**
- 2 or more seizures in ≤ 5 minutes
- **OR**
- Any seizure lasting > 5 minutes

**If duration cannot be confirmed, patient should be assumed to be in status if actively seizing when you arrived.**

---

### Status Epilepticus? (Confirmed or Suspected)

#### If No:
- Monitor and reassess

#### If Yes:

**Midazolam:**

- **IM: 10mg** (preferred route)
- **IN: 10mg** (5mg in each nare)
- **IV/IO (if already established): 6mg – 8mg**
  - May repeat to a max dose of 10 mg IV/IO

**If patient continues to seize, consider additional Midazolam with base contact**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Status Epilepticus is defined as two or more seizures without a period of consciousness or recovery, or one prolonged seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes. If patient is seizing upon EMS arrival this is likely status epilepticus. This is a true emergency requiring rapid airway control, treatment, and transport.

- For a seizure that begins in the presence of EMS, if the patient was previously conscious, alert and oriented, take the time to assess and protect the patient and providers and CONSIDER THE CAUSE. The seizure may stop, especially in patients who have prior history of self-limiting seizures. However, do not hesitate to treat recurrent or prolonged (> 5 minute) seizure activity.

- Grand Mal seizures (generalized) are associated with a loss of consciousness, incontinence, and oral trauma.

- Focal seizures (Petit Mal) affect only a part of the body and are not associated with a loss of consciousness.

- Limit IN administrations to ½ dose in each nare.

- Midazolam 10mg IM is effective in the termination of status epileptic. Do not delay IM administration to obtain IV or IO access in an actively seizing patient.

- Be prepared to assist ventilations or manage the airway, especially if Midazolam is used.

- Assess the possibility of occult trauma and substance abuse.
