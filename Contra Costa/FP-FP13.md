**Applies to:** Paramedic

## Clinical Indications

Unstable patients requiring pacing due to bradycardia may include:

- Hypotension/shock often with signs of poor perfusion
- Altered mental status
- Chest pain highly suggestive of ACS:
  - Severe crushing chest pain
  - Pale/diaphoretic
  - With or without evidence of ischemia on EKG (STEMI, T-wave inversion/depression)

---

## Procedure

1. Attach cardiac monitor using standard four-lead placement.

2. Apply defibrillation/pacing pads to chest and back:
   - One pad to left mid chest next to sternum.
   - One pad to mid left posterior chest next to spine.

3. Select pacing option on monitor unit.

4. Adjust the heart rate to 60 BPM for an adult.

5. Note pacer spikes on ECG screen.

6. Slowly increase output until capture of electrical rhythm on the monitor.

7. If unable to capture while at maximum electrical output, stop pacing immediately.

8. If capture observed on monitor, check for corresponding pulse and assess vital signs.

9. Consider the use of sedation or analgesia if patient is uncomfortable.

10. Document the dysrhythmia and the response to external pacing with ECG strips in the EHR.
