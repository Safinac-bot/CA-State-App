---

## ALGORITHM

**Review POLST or DNR form**

**Honor wishes listed on legal form**

---

### Decision Point 1: Is the patient on hospice?

**No** → Standard comfort care

**Yes** → **Hospice Pathway**

---

## HOSPICE PATHWAY

### If family member with decision-making authority is not present:

**Ask family for the phone number for their Hospice Nurse if not already on scene**

**Contact Hospice Nurse**

**Let Hospice Nurse discuss options with family, even if only over the phone**

**The family and Hospice Nurse should decide on an appropriate course of treatment or decision to transport**

---

### Decision Point 2: Honor and respect patient/family wishes, transport requested?

**No** → Complete refusal documentation

**Yes** → Continue to Decision Point 3

---

### Decision Point 3: Treatment for pain indicated?

**No** → Transport

**Yes** → **Pain Management**

---

## PAIN MANAGEMENT

### Fentanyl Administration

**If an existing patent IV is available consider:**

**Fentanyl 25 – 200mcg IV** titrated in 25 – 50mcg increments to pain relief. Consider 25mcg increments in elderly patients

---

**If no IV access consider:**

**Fentanyl 100mcg IN**
- May repeat once after 15 minutes

---

**If no IV access and IN route not advisable:**

**Fentanyl 50 – 100mcg IM**
- May repeat once after 15 minutes
- **Max of 200mcg total**

---

**Monitor and reassess 5 minutes following administration**

**Contact Base Hospital for additional order**

---

## COMFORT CARE

**If needed, provide comfort care to include:**

- Oxygen
- Open and maintain the airway using non-invasive means only (e.g. chin lift or jaw thrust)
- Suction as necessary

**Do not start resuscitation if the patient is in cardiopulmonary arrest**

---

## TRANSPORT OR REFUSAL

### If Transport:

**Notify receiving facility.**

**Transport to appropriate receiving center or requested facility of choice**

**Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.**

---

### If No Transport:

**Complete a Refusal for Service and thoroughly document encounter**

---

## PEARLS

- Hospice patients and those on palliative end of life care are often heavily medicated with pain medications. Administration of Naloxone, even in small amounts, can result in unnecessary suffering.

- Always involve the patient's assigned Hospice Nurse, even if it is by phone. It is important to recognize that families may be educated on what to expect with a dying family member, but no amount of preparation can eliminate the stress and grief of watching a loved one die.

- Follow the wishes outlined in a signed POLST or DNR order. A competent patient or designated decision maker acting on behalf of the patient can override POLST.

- If a POLST or DNR order is not immediately available, immediately initiate BLS supportive care. Do not delay care while waiting for the form.

- If transport is initiated at the request of the family and the patient subsequently goes into cardiac or respiratory arrest during transport, continue to the closest approved receiving facility.

## POLST AND DNR NOTES

**POLST forms are generally copied on pink paper to help ensure that the document stands out and is followed. However, POLST on any paper color is valid.**

**Unlike POLST, there is no standardized DNR order form. If you have doubt of a DNR order authenticity, initiate BLS care and contact the Base Hospital for guidance.**
