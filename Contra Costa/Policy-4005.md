Rev: C
10/10/2024

---

## I. PURPOSE

### A. Describe EMS Aircraft Types

To describe the types of EMS aircrafts to be used for an emergency response.

---

### B. Define Utilization Criteria

To define criteria for EMS aircraft utilization.

---

### C. Requesting EMS Aircraft

To provide direction for EMS providers to use when requesting an EMS aircraft during an emergency response.

---

### D. Canceling EMS Aircraft

To provide direction for canceling an EMS aircraft during an emergency response.

---

### E. Ground to Air Communications

To provide direction for ground to air communications.

---

## II. EMS AIRCRAFT TYPES

### A. Air Ambulance

Advanced Life Support ("ALS") medical capability with a minimum of two (2) ALS providers that can transport a patient to a receiving center. Does not have rescue capability.

---

### B. Rescue Aircraft:

1. **Auxiliary Rescue Aircraft (e.g. STARR or East Bay Regional Parks):** rescue capability only, no medical or transport to receiving center capability.

2. **Basic Life Support ("BLS") Rescue Aircraft:** A rescue aircraft whose medical flight crew has at a minimum one (1) attendant certified as an EMT or AEMT.

3. **ALS Rescue Aircraft (e.g. CHP):** rescue capability, ALS medical capability by single provider, and can transport to receiving center.

---

## III. EMS AIRCRAFT UTILIZATION CRITERIA

### A. Air Ambulance as Primary Asset

An air ambulance is the primary asset to consider when transport time to definitive care would be significantly reduced compared with ground transport time for patients who meet the following critical clinical criteria:

1. A patient who meets trauma activation with mental status and vital signs criteria or injury pattern criteria according to medical field treatment guideline T01.

---

### B. ALS Rescue Aircraft Usage

An ALS rescue aircraft may be used for emergency transport that does not involve rescue when both criteria are met:

a. Time savings will be â‰¥ 10 minutes in favor of ALS rescue versus an air ambulance.

b. Primary care person believes the patient will be adequately and effectively cared for by a single paramedic resource.

---

### C. Rescue Aircraft Consideration

A rescue aircraft (auxiliary rescue or ALS rescue) should be considered when:

1. EMS providers are unable to access the patient by ground.

2. Access to patient by ground is difficult and would delay patient contact.

---

## IV. REQUESTING AN EMS AIRCRAFT

### A. Incident Commander Request

The Incident Commander ("IC") shall request an air ambulance or rescue aircraft response through the county dispatch center.

---

### B. Request Requirements

IC shall request one air ambulance for each patient requiring an air transport. Requests should include:

1. **Ground versus air transport as related to proximity and type of incident.**
   
   a. The IC must calculate the time it will take using ground transport versus air travel to ensure patient transport time will be significantly reduced using air transport over ground transport and is in the best interest of the patient.
   
   b. The IC should consider:
      - i. ETA of air transport arrival to incident.
      - ii. Time to set up air transport/ground ambulance Emergency Landing Zone ("ELZ") if unable to land within proximity to the patient.
      - iii. Time to drive by ground ambulance to the ELZ.
      - iv. The estimated time it takes the medical flight crew to assess the patient before assuming care.
      - v. Loading the patient into the aircraft for departure.

2. Current weather conditions; and,

3. Haz-Mat considerations if pertinent.

---

## V. CANCELING AN EMS AIRCRAFT

### A. Incident Commander Responsibility

The IC is responsible for canceling an air transport response after consulting with the primary care person when:

1. EMS Aircraft Utilization Criteria is not met.

2. Prolonged ETA of an air ambulance negates the benefit of air transport.

3. Ground ambulance is prepared to transport and air transport has not arrived at the incident or ELZ.

---

## VI. COMMUNICATIONS

### A. CALCORD for Air-to-Ground Communication

CALCORD should be utilized for air-to-ground communication. If needed, the IC and the county dispatch center will designate an alternate frequency.

---

### B. Hospital Notification

The IC shall confirm that the primary care person provided early notification to the receiving hospital to prepare for patient arrival.
