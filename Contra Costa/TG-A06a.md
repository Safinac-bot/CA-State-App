**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective Date:** January 2022  
**Page:** 1 of 2

## History

- Bleeding < 24 hours after delivery
- Out of hospital delivery
- Quantity and duration of bleeding
- Placenta delivery

## Differential

- Trauma (vaginal or cervical laceration)
- Uterine atony
- Retained tissue/placenta
- Coagulopathy

## Signs and Symptoms

- Bleeding
- Dizziness/syncope
- Weakness/dyspnea
- Confusion/ALOC
- Hypotension or other signs of shock

---

## Treatment Protocol

**Primary assessment indicates post-partum (within last 24 hours) ongoing hemorrhage or hemodynamic instability**

### Supplemental Oxygen as Required

### Cardiac Monitor

### Establish IV/IO

### Fundal Massage and Placenta Management

- **Initiate gentle fundal massage to encourage delivery of placenta. If placenta delivered, massage until uterus is firm.**
- **Encourage breast feeding**

### Visualize for and Manage Bleeding from External Laceration

### Fluid Resuscitation

**Estimated blood loss >500ml AND initial SBP < 90?**

**If Yes:**

1. **Normal Saline 500ml - 1000ml bolus to maintain SBP > 90**
   - Maximum 1L

2. **Consider TXA 1gm in 100ml IV/IO over 10 minutes**

**If No:**

- Continue monitoring and reassessment

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Post-partum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the world.

- **Primary Post-partum hemorrhage** is excessive bleeding within the first 24 hours of birth. It is defined as either:
  - The loss of more than 500 ml of blood following vaginal birth;
    - Minor: 500 ml to 1 liter
    - Major: More than 1 liter
  - The loss of more than 1 liter of blood following a caesarean section; or
  - Enough blood loss to cause the mother's condition to deteriorate.

- Clinical signs of shock may not manifest until considerable blood loss has occurred. Recognition is critical.

- **Secondary PPH** is defined as a loss of more than 500 ml of blood between 24 hours postpartum and 6 weeks postpartum.

- Fundal massage is the most important intervention for primary post-partum hemorrhage. It helps contract the uterus and encourage delivery of the placenta.

- Breast feeding helps release the hormone, Oxytocin, which also helps contract the uterus.

### Causes of Post-Partum Hemorrhage

**The Four T's of Post-Partum Hemorrhage (PPH) include:**

1. **Tone** â€“ (70% of PPH incidents) Is uterine atony which occurs when the uterus fails to contract after delivery of the baby. Contraction of the uterine muscles helps deliver the placenta, and compresses blood vessels to prevent hemorrhage.

2. **Trauma** (20% of PPH incidents), which includes:
   - Lacerations of the cervix, vagina or perineum

3. **Tissue** (10% of PPH incidents), which includes:
   - Retained products, placenta, membranes or clots; or
   - An abnormal placenta

4. **Thrombin** (less than 1% of PPH incidents), which is caused by issues with coagulation.
