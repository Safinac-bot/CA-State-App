# Head Trauma

**Treatment Guideline T05**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2025

---

## History

- Time of injury
- Mechanism (blunt vs. penetrating)
- Loss of consciousness
- Past medical history
- Medications (anticoagulants)

---

## Differential

- Skull fracture
- Spinal injury
- Abuse

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- Evidence of trauma
- Pain, swelling, or bleeding
- ALOC
- Unconscious
- Respiratory distress or failure
- Vomiting
- Seizure

---

## Treatment

### E - Manage ABCs

### E - Hemorrhage Control
- Direct pressure
- Pressure bandage

### E - If indicated, spinal motion restriction (SMR)

### E - Limit scene time - Transport early

---

## POTENTIAL SEVERE HEAD INJURY?

**Any one of these:**
- LOC at any point
- GCS ≤ 14
- Any post-traumatic seizure
- Multisystem trauma requiring intubation?

### If Yes:

**E** - Secure airway and support respiratory rate

**E** - High flow O2 via NRB
- Maintain SPO2 as close to 100% as possible
- If unable to maintain SPO2 with NRB & BLS maneuvers – Proceed with BVM
- **AVOID HYPERVENTILATION**

**P** - Elevate head 30 degrees unless contraindicated.

**P** - Position patient on left side if needed for vomiting

**P** - Cardiac monitor

**P** - EtCO2 monitoring

**P** - Establish IV/IO

---

## Fluid Resuscitation

### If SBP approaching 100 or rapidly dropping in adults
Normal Saline bolus 1000ml IV/IO  
May give additional 500ml boluses IV/IO as long as criteria above exists

### If poor perfusion or shock in Pediatrics (Refer to age dependent chart)
Normal Saline bolus IV/IO  
Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide  
May repeat to age dependent goal SBP, to a Maximum 1L

---

## Nausea/Vomiting Management

### For Nausea/Vomiting Consider

**Adults** - Ondansetron 4mg IV/IO/IM/ODT  
May repeat every 10 minutes to a Maximum 12mg

**Pediatric ≥ 4 years** - Ondansetron IV/IO/IM/ODT  
Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide  
May repeat x1 for peds > 40kg

---

## Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock

| Age Group | Hypotension |
|-----------|-------------|
| Neonate | < 60 mmHg or weak pulses |
| Infant | < 70 mmHg or weak pulses |
| 1-10 years | < 70 mmHg + (age in years x2) |
| Over 10 years | < 90 mmHg |
| Over 65 years | < 110 mmHg |

---

## Exit Points

- Exit to Adult Airway TG
- Exit to Pediatric Airway TG
- If indicated, exit to appropriate TG

---

## Notification

Notify receiving facility. Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.

---

## Increased Intracranial Pressure

### General Signs:
- Changes in LOC
- Papilledema
- Impaired eye movement
- ↓ sensory/motor function
- Headache
- Pupillary changes
- Vomiting
- Changes in vital signs
  - ↑ Blood pressure
  - ↓ Pulse
- Changes in respiratory pattern

### Cushing's Triad:
- Increased BP
- Altered breathing
- Slow pulse

### Infants:
- Bulging fontanels
- Cranial suture separation
- ↑ head circumference
- High-pitched cry

---

## Pearls

- In cases of traumatic arrest, the use of Epi is not indicated.
- Scalp hemorrhage can be life threatening. Treat with direct pressure and pressure dressing.
- Consider possibility of domestic violence or child/elder abuse.
- Hypotension is age dependent. This is not always reliable and should be interpreted in context with patients normal BP, if known. Shock may be present with a seemingly normal blood pressure.

### Aggressively prevent and treat the "Three H-Bombs" of TBI:

**Hypoxemia** - Early signs include confusion and restlessness.

**Hypotension** - Usually indicates injury or shock unrelated to head Injury and should be treated aggressively.

**Hyperventilation** - Causes vasoconstriction which can lead to decreased blood supply.

### Additional Management Pearls:

- All potential TBI patients should receive continuous oxygen via NRM. Threshold > 90% O2 saturation with optimal 92-98% readings.
- Basic airway management is preferred unless unable to effectively manage with BLS maneuvers. Utilize jaw thrust technique to open the airway. Do not delay scene time to intubate.
- If patient shows any sign of inadequate oxygenation, ventilate using BVM. Use of two-finger bag valve technique is critical.

**Ventilation rates:**
- Adults 15+ : 10 BPM
- Peds 2-14 : 20 BPM
- Infants : 25 BPM

- IV Crystalloids if SBP approaching 90 or dropping rapidly in average adult.
- Target ETCO2 of 40 (range 35-45). ETCO2 may be unreliable if the patient was subject to multisystem trauma or poor perfusion.
- Assessment of baseline GCS is critical for patient care. Aggressively monitor and assess for changes by repeat examination.
- Perform modest hyperventilation to maintain an EtCO2 of 30-35 for significant signs of increased intercranial pressure or signs of brainstem herniation (dilated pupil on one side or posturing).
