## Pearls

- Be aware of ALOC as a presenting sign of an environmental toxin or Haz-mat exposure and protect personal safety and that of other responders who may already be exposed.

- Do not let alcohol confuse the clinical picture. Alcoholics frequently develop hypoglycemia and may have unrecognized injuries.

- It is safer to assume hypoglycemia than hyperglycemia if doubt exists. Recheck blood glucose after D-10 or Glucagon administration.

- Pay careful attention to the head exam for signs of bruising or other injury.

- Consider restraints if necessary for patient or personnel protection.
