## Treatment Protocol

### Assess Symptom Severity

**Any signs of airway compromise OR Other significant systemic signs?**

#### MILD (Skin symptoms +/- mild GI symptoms):

1. **Administer Oxygen with goal of ≥ 94% SpO2**

2. **Establish IV/IO**

3. **Cardiac monitor**

4. **For urticaria or angioedema consider:**
   - **Diphenhydramine IV/IO/IM**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

---

#### MODERATE/SEVERE (Airway compromise or significant systemic signs):

1. **If available, assist patient with self-prescribed Epinephrine Auto-Injector**
   - **Administer Pediatric Epinephrine Auto-Injector**
   - **Auto injector use for pediatric patient:** ≤ 30 kg – Pediatric, >30 kg - Adult

2. **Administer Oxygen with goal of ≥ 94% SpO2**

3. **Establish IV/IO**

4. **Epinephrine (1 mg/ml) IM**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

5. **Cardiac monitor**

6. **For wheezing consider Albuterol nebulizer 5mg**
   - Repeat as needed

7. **Consider Diphenhydramine IV/IO/IM**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

### Perfusion/Shock Assessment

**Poor perfusion or shock? (Refer to age dependent chart)**

#### Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock:

- **Neonate:** < 60mmHg or weak pulses
- **Infant:** < 70mmHg or weak pulses
- **1-10 years:** < 70mmHg + (age in years x2)
- **Over 10 years:** <90mmHg

**If Yes:**

1. **Normal Saline bolus IV/IO**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

2. **Poor perfusion persists 5-10 min post IM Epinephrine? (Refer to age dependent chart)**
   
   **If Yes:**
   - **Epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml) titrated in slow IV/IO**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal multisystem allergic reaction.

- Epinephrine is the drug of choice and the first drug that should be administered in acute anaphylaxis reactions with moderate or severe symptoms. IM Epinephrine should be administered as priority before or during attempts at IV or IO access.

- Allergic reactions may occur with only respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and have no rash or skin involvement.

- The shorter the onset of symptoms from contact with an allergen, generally the more severe the reaction.

- All patients with respiratory symptoms must have continuous pulse oximetry and EtCO2 measurement.

- Anaphylaxis unresponsive to repeat doses of IM Epinephrine may require IV Epinephrine administration. Contact the Base Hospital for refractory anaphylaxis.
