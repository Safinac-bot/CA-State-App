# Hypothermia

**Treatment Guideline T08**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2020

---

## History

- Age
- Exposure to decreased temperatures, but may occur in normal atmospheric temperatures
- Time and length of exposure
- Drug or alcohol use
- Infection or sepsis
- Past medical history
- Medications

---

## Differential

- Sepsis
- Environmental exposure
- Hypoglycemia
- CNS dysfunction
  - Stroke
  - Head injury
  - Spinal cord injury

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- ALOC
- Cold or clammy skins
- Shivering
- Extremity pain or sensory abnormality
- Bradycardia
- Hypotension or shock

---

## Treatment

### E - Gently move to a warm environment

### E - Remove wet clothing and cover with warm dry sheets or blankets

### E - If indicated, spinal motion restriction (SMR)

### E - If indicated, secure airway and support respiratory rate

### P - Cardiac monitor

### P - Establish IV/IO

### P - Blood glucose (BGL) analysis

---

## Fluid Resuscitation

### If SBP < 90 in adults
Normal Saline bolus 500ml IV/IO  
May repeat as long as criteria above exists

### If poor perfusion or shock in Pediatrics (Refer to age dependent chart)
Normal Saline bolus IV/IO  
Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide  
May repeat to age dependent goal SBP

---

## Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock

- **Neonate:** < 60mmHg or weak pulses
- **Infant:** < 70mmHg or weak pulses
- **1-10 years:** < 70mmHg + (age in years x2)
- **Over 10 years:** <90mmHg

---

## Exit Points

- Exit to Adult Airway TG
- Exit to Pediatric Airway TG
- Exit to Adult Diabetic TG
- Exit to Pediatric Diabetic TG
- If indicated, exit to appropriate TG

## Notification

Notify receiving facility. Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.

## Pearls

- Severe hypothermia may cause cardiac instability. Avoidance of excess stimuli is important in severe hypothermia as the heart is sensitive and interventions may induce arrhythmias. Necessary interventions should be done as gently as possible.
- The young and elderly, malnutrition, alcohol, and other drug use are contributing factors to hypothermia.
- Check for pulselessness for 30-45 seconds to avoid unnecessary chest compressions.
- Defer ACLS medications until patient is warmed.
- If V-Fib or pulseless V-Tach is present, shock x1, and defer further shocks.
- Patients with prolonged hypoglycemia often become hypothermic; blood glucose analysis is essential.
- Warm packs can be placed in the armpit and groin areas. Care should be taken not to place directly on skin.
- If a temperature is unable to be measured, treat the patient based on the suspected temperature.
