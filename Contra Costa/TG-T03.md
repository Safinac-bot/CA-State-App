# Burns

**Treatment Guideline T03**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2025

---

## History

- Type of exposure (heat, gas, or chemical)
- Inhalation injury involved
- Time of injury
- Other trauma
- Past medical history
- Medications

---

## Differential

- **Superficial** – red and painful (do not include in Total Body Surface Area)
- **Partial thickness** – blistering
- **Full thickness** – painless with charred or leathery skin
- Chemical injury
- Thermal injury
- Radiation injury
- Blast injury

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- Inhalation injury: Respiratory distress or horse voice with soot in mouth/throat or nose
- ALOC or unconsciousness suggest CO/CN poisoning

---

## Treatment

### Assess burn injury severity

### E - Remove rings, bracelets, and constricting items

### E - Consider high flow Oxygen via NRB for suspected CO/CN toxicity

### P - Cardiac monitor

### P - EtCO2 monitoring

### E - Maintain airway

### E - Apply clean dressing to burn area

---

## Major Burns

**Criteria:**
- ≥ 20% TBSA partial or full thickness burns
- Burns with suspected inhalation injury
- High voltage electrical burns

**Treatment:**
- **P** - Consider IV/IO (Consider one ≥ 20g IV in each AC)
- **P** - Administer fluids:
  - ≤ 5 year old – 125 ml
  - 6-12 year old – 250 ml
  - ≥ 13 year old – 500 ml

**Transport to appropriate facility:**
- Burns with trauma to Trauma Center
- Inhalation with potentially unstable airway to closest receiving facility
- All others consider direct transport to a Burn Center

### Approved Burn Receiving Centers

**Adults Only:**
- Valley Med. Center – San Jose
- UC Davis – Sacramento
- St. Francis – San Francisco

---

## Minor Burns

**Criteria:**
- < 20% TBSA partial or full thickness burns
- No inhalation injury
- GCS > 13

**Transport:**
- Transport to facility of choice
- Consider transporting to Burn Center for burns to the face, hands, perineum, feet, or circumferential burns

---

## Exit Points

- Exit to Trauma Triage TG
- Exit to Adult Pain Control
- Exit to Pediatric Pain Control

---

## Notification

Notify receiving facility. Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.

---

## Rule of Nines

- Seldom will you find a complete isolated body part that is injured as described in the Rule of Nines. More likely, it will be portions of one area, portions of another, and an approximation will be needed.
- For the purpose of determining the extent of serious injury, differentiate the area with minimal (superficial) burn from those of partial or full thickness burns.
- When calculating TBSA of burns, include only partial and full thickness burns; do not include superficial burns in the calculation.

---

## Pearls

- Airway burns may lead to rapid compromise of the airway and can be identified by soot around the nares or mouth or visible burns or edematous mucosa in the mouth.
- Circumferential burns to extremities are dangerous due to potential vascular compromise secondary to soft tissue swelling.
- Early intubation is required when the patient experiences significant inhalation injuries. If the patient requires advanced airway management that cannot be quickly achieved in the field, transport to the nearest facility for stabilization prior to transfer to the Burn Center. Do not wait for a helicopter if airway patency is a critical concern.
- For major burns, do not apply wet dressings, liquids or gels to burns unless it is to remove whatever caused the burn (i.e. dry chemical agent, etc.). Cooling large burns may lead to hypothermia.
- Burn patients are often trauma patients. If burns are evident in the presence of trauma, follow trauma triage guidelines and transport to trauma center if activation criteria is met.
- Never administer IM pain medication into a burned area.
