**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective Date:** January 2023  
**Page:** 1 of 2

---

## History

- Age
- Medications
- Past medical history (e.g. MI, angina, diabetes, CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia)
- Recent physical exertion
- Provocation
- Quality (e.g. pressure, constant, sharp, dull, etc.)
- Region/Radiation/Referred
- Severity (0 – 10 scale)
- Time (onset/duration/repetition)

## Differential

- Acute coronary syndrome (MI, unstable angina)
- Pulmonary embolus
- Aortic dissection
- Pericarditis
- Pneumothorax
- Pneumonia
- Tamponade

## Signs and Symptoms

- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Pale, cool, diaphoretic
- Nausea, vomiting
- Hypotension or shock
- Possible bradycardia
- Syncope

**Atypical presentations for elderly patients:**
- Epigastric pain
- Generalized weakness

## Treatment Protocol

### Primary Assessment

**Primary assessment indicates chest pain or signs/symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia**

### Cardiac Monitor

### Oxygen

- Titrate to SpO2 ≥ 94%

### Aspirin

**Aspirin 324mg PO**

### 12-Lead ECG

### STEMI Assessment

**Definition of STEMI:**
- > 1mm ST segment elevation in inferior, or
- > 2mm ST segment elevation in anterior or lateral leads,
- In 2 or more contiguous leads
- (See 12-Lead Procedure)

**STEMI Present?**

#### If STEMI:

1. **Immediate transmission of 12-lead to STEMI receiving facility**

2. **Make STEMI ALERT notification and initiate transport to STEMI receiving facility**

#### If No STEMI:

- Continue with treatment protocol below

### Establish IV/IO

### Nitroglycerin Administration

**If initial SBP > 90:**

**Nitroglycerin 0.4mg sublingual**
- May repeat every 5 minutes as needed
- Maximum 3 doses
- Use caution and consider base contact if HR >120 prior to administration
- **Do not administer if patient has taken erectile dysfunction drugs:**
  - (e.g. Viagra, Levitra) within the last 24 hours, or
  - (e.g. Cialis) within 36 hours

**If SBP <90 or drops >30 from baseline after NTG:**
- Withhold further NTG administration
- **Normal Saline bolus 500ml IV/IO**
  - May repeat as needed
  - Maximum 1L

### Pain Management

**Consider Fentanyl 25 – 200mcg IV titrated in 25 – 50mcg increments for pain relief if SBP > 90**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Many STEMIs evolve during prehospital care and may not be noted on the initial 12-Lead ECG.

- An ECG should be obtained prior to treatment for bradycardia if patient condition permits.

- If a patient has taken their own Nitroglycerin without relief, consider potency of medication. Provider maximum doses do not include patient administered doses.

- Monitor for hypotension after administration of nitroglycerin and opioids.

- Diabetics, geriatric, and female patients often have atypical pain (e.g. epigastric pain, r-sided chest pain, jaw pain), or only generalized complaints (e.g. weakness, nausea/vomiting, sweating). Suspect cardiac etiology in these patients, and perform a 12-Lead ECG.

### ST Elevation Patterns

- **ST Elevation in 2 or more leads: Leads II, III, aVF**  
  Inferior wall MI (vessel likely RCA or LCx)

- **ST Elevation in 2 or more leads: Leads I, aVL, V5, V6**  
  Lateral wall MI (vessel likely LCx or LAD branch)

- **ST Elevation in 2 or more leads: Leads V1, V2**  
  Septal wall MI (vessel likely LCx or LAD branch)

- **ST Elevation in 2 or more leads: Leads V3, V4**  
  Anterior wall MI (vessel likely LCx or LAD branch)

- **Look for ST DEPRESSION in reciprocal leads (opposite wall) to confirm diagnosis.**

- **Isolated ST elevation in aVR with ST depression in all other leads** should raise suspicion for a proximal LAD Artery injury or Left Main Coronary Artery abnormality. This is not STEMI criteria, but the 12-Lead ECG should be transmitted to the ED for consultation. Consider transport to a STEMI receiving center.

### Lead Groupings

- **Lateral:** I, aVL, V5, V6
- **Inferior:** II, III, aVF
- **Septal:** V1, V2
- **Anterior:** V3, V4
- **(RVMI):** Right ventricular MI consideration

### Further Direction

- Transmit all 12-Lead ECGs whether STEMI is detected or not.

- Document 12-Lead ECG acquisition and transmission times along with interpretation in the PCR.
