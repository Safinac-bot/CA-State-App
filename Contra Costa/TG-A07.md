## Treatment Protocol

### Blood Glucose (BGL) Analysis

**BGL ≤ 60mg/dl or ≥ 350mg/dl?**

#### If No (BGL between 60-350):
- Consider Cardiac Monitor
- Consider IV/IO
- Consider Normal Saline bolus 500-1000ml IV

---

#### If Yes - HYPOGLYCEMIA (BGL ≤ 60mg/dl):

**Able to follow commands?**

##### If Yes (Able to follow commands):
- **Consider Oral Glucose 30g**
- Consider Cardiac Monitor
- Consider IV/IO

##### If No (Unable to follow commands):

1. **Establish IV/IO**

2. **D-10 100ml IV**
   - Consider IO access as a last resort

3. **If no venous access:**
   - **Glucagon 1mg IM**
   - May repeat in 15 minutes

4. **Improving?**

   **If No:**
   - **If blood glucose ≤ 60mg/dl: D-10 150ml IV**
   - Continue reassessment

   **If Yes:**
   - **Returns to baseline?**
     
     **If Yes:**
     - Recommend transport or conduct Refusal if indicated
     
     **If No:**
     - Continue treatment and transport

---

#### If Yes - HYPERGLYCEMIA (BGL ≥ 350mg/dl):

**BGL ≥ 350mg/dl with signs and symptoms of DKA?**

##### DKA Signs and Symptoms:
- Abdominal pain
- Weakness, fatigue
- Fruity smelling breath
- Altered mental status
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea or vomiting
- Dry mucous membranes/extreme dehydration

**If Yes (DKA suspected):**

1. **Establish IV/IO**

2. **Normal Saline bolus 500-1000ml IV**

3. **Base Hospital for additional order**

**If No:**
- Consider IV/IO
- Consider Cardiac Monitor
- Consider Normal Saline bolus 500-1000ml IV

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

---

## Types of Insulin and Brand Names

### Rapid Acting
- Lisipro (Humalog)
- Aspart (NovoLog)
- Glulisine (Apidra)

### Intermediate and Long Acting
- NPH
- Insulin glargine (Lantus, Basaglar, Toujoe)
- Insulin (Levemir)
- Insulin degludec (Tresiba)

## Pearls

- Patients with prolonged hypoglycemia may not respond to Glucagon.

- Response to Glucagon can take 15-20 minutes. Consider the entire clinical picture when treating hypoglycemia, including a patient's overall clinical condition and other vital signs. It may be safe to wait for some time for Glucagon to work instead of pursuing the more aggressive course of performing IO access to give faster acting D10 solution.

- Diabetics may have poor wound healing capabilities, and IO access may present a greater risk for infection or complicate the patient's long-term condition due to poor wound healing. IO access may also present a greater risk for infection. On the other hand, consider IO access to give D-10 solution early in patients who are critically ill or peri-arrest and hypoglycemic.

- Do not administer oral glucose to patients that are not able to swallow or protect their airway.

- Recheck BGL after each D-10 or Glucagon administration.

- Hypoglycemic patients who have experienced a seizure should be transported to the hospital irrespective of their mental status and therapeutic response.

- **For patients refusing transport to a hospital after treatment of hypoglycemia, non-transport should only be considered when the following are true:**
  - Repeat glucose measurement is greater than 80 mg/dL.
  - The patient is not taking oral diabetic medication to control blood sugar (excluding Metformin). There is risk of recurrent hypoglycemia that can be delayed for hours and requires close monitoring even after a prehospital blood glucose level of greater than 60mg/dl has been achieved.
  - The patient returns to normal mental status, with no focal neurologic signs/symptoms after receiving glucose/dextrose.
  - The patient can promptly obtain and will eat a carbohydrate meal.
  - The parent or legal guardian refuses transport, and EMS providers agree transport not indicated.
  - A reliable adult will be staying with the patient.
  - No significant co-morbid symptoms exist, like chest pain, shortness of breath, seizures, intoxication.
  - A clear cause of hypoglycemia is identifiable (e.g., missed meal).
