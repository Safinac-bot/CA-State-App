# Synchronized Cardioversion

**Field Procedure FP-FP31**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2022  
**Applies to:** Paramedic

---

## Clinical Indications

1) Unstable patient with a tachydysrhythmia (rapid atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia)

2) Patient is not pulseless (the pulseless patient requires unsynchronized cardioversion, i.e., defibrillation)

---

## Procedure

1) Completely expose the chest. Remove medication patches, if present.

2) Properly attach the patient to the monitor/defibrillator. Pads should be placed at least 10 cm from a PPM/AICD.

3) Consider the use of pain or sedating medications.

4) Set energy selection to the appropriate setting.

5) Set monitor/defibrillator to synchronized cardioversion mode.

6) Make certain all personnel are clear of patient.

7) Press and hold the shock button to cardiovert. Stay clear of the patient until you are certain the energy has been delivered. **NOTE:** It may take the monitor/defibrillator several cardiac cycles to "synchronize", so there may a delay between activating the cardioversion and the actual delivery of energy.

8) Observe patient response and perform immediate unsynchronized cardioversion/defibrillation if the patient's rhythm converts to pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation.

9) If the patient's condition is unchanged, repeat with escalating energy settings, as above. Repeat until maximum setting or until efforts succeed.

10) Consider base consultation if cardioversion is unsuccessful after 3 attempts.

## Energy Settings

### For the adult:

**Immediate Synchronized Cardioversion**
- **Narrow Regular:** 100J, 150J, 200J…
- **Narrow Irregular:** 150J, 200J, 300J…
- **Wide Regular:** 150J, 200J, 300J…
- **Wide Irregular:** Defibrillate 360J

If any delay in synchronized cardioversion and the patient is critical, defibrillate 360J

Contact Base Hospital for further direction if recurrent or resistant to initial three (3) shocks

### For the pediatric patient:

**Synchronized cardioversion**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
- May repeat if necessary – refer to dosing guide for repeat energy doses
