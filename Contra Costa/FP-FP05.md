**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective Date:** January 2020  
**Applies to:** EMT, Paramedic  
**Page:** 1 of 1

## Clinical Indications

1. Sudden onset of respiratory distress often with coughing, wheezing, gagging, or stridor due to a foreign-body obstruction of the upper airway.

---

## Procedure

### 1. Assess the Degree of Foreign Body Obstruction

- **Do not interfere with a mild obstruction;** allow the patient to clear their airway by coughing.
- In severe foreign-body obstructions, the patient may not be able to make a sound. The patient may clutch his/her neck demonstrating the universal choking sign.

### 2. For an Infant

Deliver **5 back blows (slaps)** followed by **5 chest thrusts** repeatedly until the object is expelled or the patient becomes unresponsive.

### 3. For a Child

Perform a **subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrust (Heimlich Maneuver)** until the object is expelled or the patient becomes unresponsive.

### 4. For Adults

A combination of maneuvers may be required.

- **First,** subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver) should be used in rapid sequence until the obstruction is relieved.

- **If abdominal thrusts are ineffective,** chest thrusts should be used. Chest thrusts should be used primarily in morbidly obese patients and in patients who are in the late stages of pregnancy.

### 5. If the Patient Becomes Unresponsive

Begin CPR immediately but look in the mouth before administering any ventilations. If a foreign-body is visible, remove it.

### 6. Do Not Perform Blind Finger Sweeps

**Do not perform blind finger sweeps in the mouth and posterior pharynx.** This may push the object farther into the airway.

### 7. For Paramedics - Unresponsive Patients

In unresponsive patients, Paramedics should visualize the posterior pharynx with a laryngoscope to potentially identify and remove the foreign-body using Magill forceps.

### 8. Documentation

Document the methods used and result of these procedures in the EHR.
