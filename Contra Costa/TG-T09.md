# Major Hemorrhage Control

**Treatment Guideline T09**  
**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective:** Jan. 2025

---

## History

- Quantity and duration of bleeding
- Meds (anticoagulants)
- Recent trauma
- Pregnant or menstruating
- Recent Surgery

---

## Differential

- Trauma
- Coagulopathy
- GI bleed
- Urinary tract pathology
- Vaginal bleeding (all causes)

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- Visible external bleeding
- Melena
- Rectal bleeding
- Hematuria
- Vaginal bleeding
- Dizziness/syncope
- Weakness/dyspnea
- Confusion/ALOC
- Hypotension or other signs of shock

---

## Treatment

### E - Apply direct pressure/pressure dressing to injury

### P - Cardiac monitor

### P - Establish IV/IO

### P - If indicated, secure airway and support respiratory rate

---

## Decision Point: Extremity Injury?

### Yes - Extremity Injury:

**E** - Apply tourniquet(s) (FP21)

**E** - Consider Hemostatic Gauze (FP28) for junctional injury not amenable to tourniquet

---

## Hemorrhage Controlled?

### No:

**P** - Cardiac monitor

**P** - Establish IV/IO

---

## Tranexamic Acid (TXA)

**P** - Consider TXA 1gm in 100ml IV/IO over 10 minutes

### Indications (all three must be met)
1) Age â‰¥ 15
2) Blunt/penetrating trauma and injury within 3 hours or postpartum hemorrhage
3) SBP < 90 due to uncontrolled hemorrhage

### Contraindications
1) Isolated head injury (blunt or penetrating)
2) Cervical cord injury with motor deficit
3) Traumatic arrest (with > 5 minutes CPR without ROSC)
4) Isolated drowning or hanging victims

---

## Fluid Resuscitation

### If SBP < 90 in adults
Normal Saline bolus 500ml IV/IO  
May repeat as long as criteria above exists

### If poor perfusion or shock in Pediatrics (Refer to age dependent chart)
Normal Saline bolus IV/IO  
Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide  
May repeat to age dependent goal SBP

---

## Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock

- **Neonate:** < 60mmHg or weak pulses
- **Infant:** < 70mmHg or weak pulses
- **1-10 years:** < 70mmHg + (age in years x2)
- **Over 10 years:** <90mmHg

## Notification

Notify receiving facility. Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.

## Pearls

- Hypotension indicates stage 3 hypovolemic shock and at least 1500 cc of blood loss.
- Tachycardia (if not due to other causes) is a hallmark of stage 2 hypovolemic shock. Providers should anticipate progression, resuscitate with crystalloid fluids and prepare to administer TXA should hypotension occur.
- Pressure dressing indications include limb, torso, and head wounds with significant bleeding. Dressings can also be applied as an adjunct to hemostatic agent.
- Tourniquet indications include life threatening hemorrhage to limbs and amputations/mangled limb with multiple locations of bleeding. If hemorrhage is not controlled with one tourniquet, a second can be applied more proximally.
- Scene time for major trauma patients should be limited to < 10 minutes whenever possible.
- In patients older than 65 years old, an SBP in the low 100 range may constitute relative hypotension. Be proactive about fluid replacement.
- Transport should NOT be delayed to administer fluids or TXA. Administer these during transport if time permits.
- Wound packing locations include limbs, neck, shoulder, hips, and groin. (Do not pack abdomen, chest, skull, or any injuries to the eyes or airway).
- Early communication to advise the receiving hospital of the use of TXA is critical.
- Make sure to label the medication on the IV bag.
