## Treatment Protocol

### Initial Assessment

**Term gestation? Breathing or crying? Good muscle tone?**

#### If Yes (All three criteria met):

1. **Provide warmth/dry infant**
2. **Clear airway if necessary**
3. **Maintain warmth**
4. **Monitor and reassess**
5. **Monitor SpO2**

---

#### If No (Any criteria not met):

1. **Warm, dry, and vigorously stimulate, clear airway if necessary**

2. **Monitor SpO2**

### Targeted SpO2 after Birth:

- **1 min** – 60-65%
- **2 min** – 65-70%
- **3 min** – 70-75%
- **4 min** – 75-80%
- **5 min** – 80-85%
- **10 min** – 85-90%

---

### Heart Rate Assessment

**Heart rate > 100?**

#### If Yes:
- **Monitor and reassess**
- Continue monitoring

---

#### If No - Heart rate < 100 or Labored breathing or persistent cyanosis:

1. **BVM ventilations**
   - If repeating cycle, take correction action by changing BVM position or technique

2. **Cardiac monitor**

3. **Supplemental Oxygen**

4. **Maintain warmth**

5. **Monitor SpO2**

**Reassess heart rate:**

---

### Heart rate < 60:

1. **Begin chest compressions**
   - 3:1 ratio

2. **BVM ventilations**
   - If repeating cycle, take correction action by changing BVM position or technique

3. **Cardiac monitor**

4. **Supplemental Oxygen**

5. **Maintain warmth**

6. **IV/IO procedure**

7. **Epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml) IV/IO every 3-5 minutes as needed**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

8. **Normal saline bolus**
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

### Return of Spontaneous Circulation

**AT ANY TIME - If Return of Spontaneous Circulation:**
- **Exit to Post ROSC TG**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

---

## Pearls

- Term gestation, strong cry/breathing and with good muscle tone generally will need no resuscitation.

- Most newborns requiring resuscitation will respond to stimulation, ventilation/BVM, compressions, or Epinephrine. If not responding, consider hypovolemia, pneumothorax, or hypoglycemia (< 40mg/dl).

- Most important vital signs in the newly born are respirations/respiratory effort and heart rate.

- Maternal sedation or narcotics will sedate an infant.

- Naloxone is no longer recommended for use in the newly born who may be sedated from maternal medications.

- Transport mother WITH infant whenever possible.

- It is extremely important to keep an infant warm. Do not place hot packs directly on baby's skin as it may cause severe burns.

- Place baby skin-to-skin on mother.

### Common Pediatric Terms:

- **Newly born** are ≤ 24 hours old
- **Neonates** are ≤ 28 days old
- **Infants** are ≤ 1 year old
