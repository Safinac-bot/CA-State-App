## Pearls

- Simple febrile seizures are most common in ages 6 months to 5 years of age. They are, by definition, generalized seizures with no seizure history in the setting of any grade of fever, with an otherwise normal neurologic and physical exam. Any seizure confirmed to last for more than five (5) minutes should be treated with medication.

- Be prepared to assist ventilations, especially if Midazolam is used. Avoiding hypoxemia is extremely important.

- In an infant, a seizure may be the only evidence of a closed head injury.

- Status epilepticus is defined as two or more successive seizures without a period of consciousness or recovery OR seizures lasting greater than 5 minutes. This is a true emergency requiring rapid airway control, treatment and transport.

- It is important to assess for the possibility of occult trauma and substance abuse, overdose, or ingestion/toxins.
