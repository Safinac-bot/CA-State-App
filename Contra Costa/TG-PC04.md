# Treatment Guideline PC04
## Post Resuscitation (ROSC) - Pediatric

**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective Date:** January 2025  
**Page:** 1 of 1

---

## History

- Respiratory arrest
- Cardiac arrest

## Differential

- Continue to address specific differentials associated with the original dysrhythmia

## Signs and Symptoms

- Return of spontaneous circulation

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Repeat Primary Assessment

### Optimize Ventilation and Oxygenation

- Maintain SpO2 ≥ 94%
- Maintain respiratory rate of 10/minute for EtCO2 35 – 45
- **DO NOT HYPERVENTILATE**

### Advanced Airway Management

**For patients > 40kg:**
- Intubate with cuffed ETT as appropriate
- **OR**
- Place i-Gel, refer to weight-based guide

### Establish IV/IO if Not Previously Established

### Blood Glucose (BGL) Analysis

**If BGL < 60 mg/dl:**

**D-10 IV**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

### Perfusion/Shock Assessment

**If poor perfusion or shock (Refer to age dependent chart):**

**Normal Saline bolus IV/IO**
- Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide
- May repeat to age dependent goal SBP

#### Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock

- **Neonate:** < 60mmHg or weak pulses
- **Infant:** < 70mmHg or weak pulses
- **1-10 years:** < 70mmHg + (age in years x2)
- **Over 10 years:** <90mmHg

### Seizure Management

**If signs of seizure:**

**Midazolam IN (preferred) or IM**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
- Max single dose: 5 mg (≤ 40 kg) and 10 mg (> 40 kg)

### Monitor Vital Signs

**Note:** Worsening bradycardia in ROSC patients may indicate impending rearrest

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Hyperventilation is a significant cause of hypotension/recurrence of cardiac arrest in the post resuscitation phase and must be avoided at all costs.
