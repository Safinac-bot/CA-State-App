## Rescue Breathing Rate (ages/resp rates)

| Age | Respiratory Rate |

| Newborn | 40-60 |
| 2-5 | 25-30 |
| 6-12 | 20-25 |
| >12 | 15-20 |

## Treatment Protocol

### If Indicated, Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR)

### Airway Patency Assessment

**Airway patent?**

#### If No:
1. **Open airway chin lift/jaw thrust**
2. **Airway foreign body obstruction procedure**
3. **Complete obstruction?**
   - If Yes:
     - **Abdominal thrusts (conscious)**
     - **Chest compression (unconscious)**
     - **Direct laryngoscopy**

#### If Yes:
- Continue to ventilatory support assessment

### Ventilatory Support Assessment

**Ventilatory support required?**

#### If No:
- **Exit to appropriate TG**

#### If Yes:

1. **Supplemental Oxygen via BVM**
   - Goal to maintain Oxygen Saturation ≥ 94%

2. **BVM effective?**

   **If Yes:**
   - **Supplemental Oxygen via BVM**
   - Goal to maintain Oxygen Saturation ≥ 94%
   - **Monitor continuous EtCO2**
   - Transport to closest receiving facility

   **If No:**
   
   a. **For patients > 40kg:**
      - Intubate with ETT as appropriate
      - **OR**
      - Place i-Gel, refer to weight-based guide
   
   b. **The maximum allowed attempts for an advanced airway placement is two (2).**
      - If an attempt fails, reassess and approach with a different technique
   
   c. **Monitor continuous EtCO2**
   
   d. **Reassess airway procedure and adjust if necessary**

3. **Consider sedation if i-Gel or ETT in place:**
   - Midazolam IV/IM/IO
   - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

4. **Transport to closest receiving facility**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Airway is a more important intervention in pediatric arrests. This should be accomplished quickly with a BVM and appropriately sized mask. Patient survival is often dependent on proper ventilation and oxygenation.

- Effective use of a BVM requires two (2) people.

- If an effective airway is being maintained with a BVM and a basic airway adjunct with continuous pulse oximetry values of ≥ 90% or values expected based on pathophysiologic condition with otherwise reassuring vital sign (e.g. pulse oximetry of 85% with otherwise normal vital signs in a post-drowning patient), it is expected to continue with basic airway measures.

- Hyperventilation in deteriorating head trauma should only be done to maintain an EtCO2 of 30-35.

- An appropriate ventilatory rate is one that maintains an EtCO2 of 35 or greater. Avoid hyperventilation.

- For the purposes of this TG, a secure airway is achieved when the patient is receiving appropriate oxygenation and ventilation.

- Patients with perfusing pulses should be managed with a BLS airway unless unable to successfully ventilate.

- Endotracheal intubation is only approved for patients over 40kg.

### Contraindications for i-Gel:

- Presence of gag reflex
- Laryngectomy with stoma (alternatively place ET in stoma)
- Caustic ingestion
- Known esophageal disease

### Additional Considerations:

- It is important to secure the advanced airway well and consider c-collar (in the absence of trauma) to better maintain advanced airway placement. Manual stabilization of advanced airway should be used during all patient moves/transfers.

- An intubation attempt is defined as inserting the laryngoscope blade with the intent to intubate or inserting advanced airway past the teeth.

- Continuous waveform capnography (EtCO2) is mandatory for the monitoring of all respiratory patients and methods of airway management. Document results.

- Maintain spinal immobilization for patients with suspected spinal injury.
