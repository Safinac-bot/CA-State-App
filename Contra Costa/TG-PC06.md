**Effective Date:** January 2023  
**Page:** 1 of 2

## History

- Past medical history
- Medications or toxic ingestion (e.g. Aminophylline, Adderall, diet pills, thyroid supplements, decongestants and Digoxin)
- Drugs (e.g. nicotine and illegal drugs)
- Congenital heart disease
- Respiratory distress
- Syncope / near syncope

## Differential

- Heart disease (congenital)
- Hyperthermia
- Hypovolemia or anemia
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Anxiety / Pain / Emotional stress
- Fever / Infection / Sepsis
- Hypoxia
- Hypoglycemia
- Medication / Toxin / Drugs
- Pulmonary embolus
- Trauma
- Tension Pneumothorax

## Signs and Symptoms

- **Heart rate:** Child > 180, Infant > 220
- Pale or cyanosis
- Diaphoresis
- Tachypnea
- Vomiting
- Hypotension
- Altered mental status
- Pulmonary congestion
- Syncope

## Treatment Protocol

### Initial Assessment and Support

**Maintain patent airway; assist breathing as necessary**

**Administer Oxygen with goal of ≥ 94% SpO2**

### Cardiac Monitor

### 12 Lead or Rhythm Strip

### Unstable due to Tachycardia?

#### Unstable due to Tachycardia Criteria:

- Typical HR Child >180, Infant > 220
- Hypotension/shock often with signs of poor perfusion
- Altered mental status

---

#### If UNSTABLE:

1. **Establish IV/IO**

2. **Narrow or Wide QRS?**

   **Narrow QRS ≤ 0.09 sec (e.g. SVT):**
   - **Consider sedation pre-cardioversion:**
     - Midazolam IV/IO
     - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
     - Max 5mg
   - **Synchronized cardioversion**
     - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
     - May repeat if necessary – refer to dosing guide for repeat energy doses

   **Wide QRS > 0.09 sec (e.g. V-Tach):**
   - **Consider sedation pre-cardioversion:**
     - Midazolam IV/IO
     - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
     - Max 5mg
   - **Synchronized cardioversion**
     - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
     - May repeat if necessary – refer to dosing guide for repeat energy doses

---

#### If STABLE:

**Probable Sinus Tach if:**
- P-Waves present and normal
- Variable PR Interval
- Infant HR usually < 220
- Child HR usually < 180

**Treatment for Sinus Tachycardia:**
- Treat underlying cause
- Continue monitoring

**If NOT Sinus Tachycardia:**

1. **Narrow or Wide QRS?**

   **Narrow QRS ≤ 0.09 sec (e.g. SVT):**
   
   a. **Consider Vagal maneuver (FP22)**
   
   b. **Establish IV/IO**
   
   c. **Adenosine IV/IO rapid push**
      - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
   
   d. **Rhythm persists?**
      
      **If Yes:**
      - **Adenosine IV/IO rapid push**
      - Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
      - May repeat 1 time

   **Wide QRS > 0.09 sec (e.g. V-Tach):**
   
   a. **Establish IV/IO**
   
   b. **If symptomatic (dizzy, SOB, etc), consider base contact for Amiodarone**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Most important goal is to differentiate the type of tachycardia and if STABLE or UNSTABLE.

- **Stable** is defined as hemodynamically stable (e.g. normal blood pressure, delay in capillary refill, alert and oriented).

- **Unstable** is defined by poor perfusion with AMS, abnormal pulses, delayed capillary refill, or difficult or unable to palpate a blood pressure.

- If at any point the patient becomes unstable, move to the unstable arm of the algorithm.

- Early transport is always appropriate in unstable patients.

- For ASYMPTOMATIC patients (or those with only minimal symptoms, such as palpitations) and any tachycardia with a rate of < 150 with a normal blood pressure, consider CLOSE OBSERVATION or fluid bolus rather than immediate treatment with an anti-arrhythmic medication.

- Separating the child from the caregiver may worsen the child's clinical condition.

- Pediatric pads should be used in children < 10kg or Pediatape measurement of Purple.

- Monitor for respiratory depression and associated hypotension associated if Midazolam is used.

- Use Pediatape for pediatric weight measurement. ALWAYS use the weight-based dosing guide.

- Search for and treat causes.
