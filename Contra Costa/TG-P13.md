## Pearls

- **Heart rate:** One of the first clinical signs of dehydration is almost always an increased heart rate. Tachycardia increases as dehydration becomes more severe, very unlikely to be significantly dehydrated if heart rate is close to normal.

- Beware of only vomiting (without diarrhea) in children. Pyloric stenosis, bowel obstruction, and CNS processes (bleeding, tumors, or increased CSF pressures) all often present with isolated vomiting.

- Ondansetron is not indicated for motion sickness.
