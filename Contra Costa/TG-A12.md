## History

- Blood loss
- Fluid loss (vomiting, diarrhea or fever)
- Infection (e.g., UTI, cellulitis, etc.)
- Cardiac ischemia (MI or CHF)
- Medications
- Allergic reaction
- Pregnancy
- History of poor oral intake

## Differential

- Shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, septic, neurogenic or anaphylaxis)
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Cardiac dysrhythmias
- Pulmonary embolus
- Tension pneumothorax
- Medication effect or overdose
- Vasovagal effect
- Physiologic (pregnancy)

## Signs and Symptoms

- Restlessness or confusion
- Weakness or dizziness
- Weak, rapid pulse
- Pale, cool, clammy skin signs
- Delayed capillary refill
- Hypotension
- Coffee-ground emesis
- Tarry stools

## Treatment Protocol

### Cardiac Monitor

### History, Exam and Circumstances Assessment

**History, exam and circumstances often suggest the type of shock:**

Consider:
- Hypovolemic (dehydration or GI bleed)
- Cardiogenic (STEMI or CHF)
- Obstructive (PE or cardiac tamponade) shock

### If Indicated, Exit Airway TG

### Anaphylaxis Assessment

**Anaphylaxis?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis TG**

### Sepsis Assessment

**Sepsis?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Sepsis TG**

### Trauma Assessment

**Was trauma involved?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Major Hemorrhage Control TG**

### IV/IO Procedure

### Fluid Resuscitation

**With clear lung sounds:**

**Normal Saline bolus 500ml IV/IO**
- Repeat to goal SBP > 90
- Maximum 1L

### Positive STEMI Assessment

**Positive STEMI?**

**If Yes:**
- **Consider 12-Lead ECG for cardiogenic shock**
- **Exit to Chest Pain/STEMI TG**

### Refractory Hypotension Management

**In patients with severe hypotension refractory to fluid bolus:**

**Consider Push Dose Epi 1 ml (10 mcg) IV/IO every 3 min**
- Titrate to SBP > 90

**Contact Base Hospital Physician for additional order**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Hypotension can be defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 90mmHg. This is not always reliable and should be interpreted in context with the patient's typical BP, if known. Shock may be present with a seemingly normal blood pressure initially.

- Shock is often present with normal vital signs and may develop insidiously. Tachycardia may be the only manifestation.

- Consider all causes of shock and treat per appropriate Treatment Guideline.

### Types of Shock:

#### Hypovolemic shock:
- Hemorrhage, trauma, GI bleeding, ruptured AAA, or pregnancy-related bleeding

#### Cardiogenic shock:
- Heart failure, MI, cardiomyopathy, myocardial contusion, ruptured ventricle/septum/valve or toxins

#### Distributive shock:
- Sepsis, anaphylactic, neurogenic, or toxins
- Neurogenic shock generally presents with warm, dry, and pink skin with normal capillary refill time; patient typically alert

#### Obstructive shock:
- Pericardial tamponade, PE, or tension pneumothorax
- Signs may include hypotension with distended neck veins, tachycardia, unilateral decreased breath sounds or muffled heart tones
