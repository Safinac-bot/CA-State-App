## Pearls

- Syncope is both a loss of consciousness and loss of postural tone. Symptoms preceding the event are important in determining etiology.

- Syncope, particularly in younger patients, is often due to a benign process but can be an indication of a serious underlying disease.

- Patients with syncope are often found normal on EMS evaluation. Older patients who have experienced syncope require cardiac monitoring and emergency department evaluation. Transport should be encouraged for these patients. More than 25% of geriatric syncope is cardiac arrhythmia based.

- Consider all etiologies; syncope could be due to something that isn't immediately obvious.
