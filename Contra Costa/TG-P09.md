- Hypo or hypertension
- Decreased respiratory rate
- Tachycardia or dysrhythmias
- Seizures
- S.L.U.D.G.E.

## Treatment Protocol

### Administer Oxygen with Goal of ≥ 94% SpO2

### Consider IV/IO

### Cardiac Monitor

### Consider 12-Lead ECG

### Inadequate Respirations (< 8) and Oxygenation?

**If Yes:**

**For patients > 22kg:**
- **Naloxone 2-4 mg IN**
- Naloxone is titrated to effect of adequate ventilation and oxygenation
- **NOT ADMINISTERED TO RESTORE CONSCIOUSNESS**

**Other patients:**
- **Naloxone IV/IM/IN**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
- Naloxone is titrated to effect of adequate ventilation and oxygenation
- **NOT ADMINISTERED TO RESTORE CONSCIOUSNESS**

**Support ventilation to maintain respiratory rate of 12/min**

**If No:**
- Continue assessment

### If Indicated, Exit to Pediatric Airway TG

### Specific Overdose Management

#### Tricyclic Antidepressant or Anticholinergic OD
**(e.g. massive Benadryl OD) with QRS ≥ 0.12 AND poor perfusion or shock (Refer to age dependent chart)**

**Sodium Bicarb IV/IO**
- Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide

---

#### Beta Blocker or Calcium Channel Blocker OD
**With HR < 50 AND poor perfusion or shock (Refer to age dependent chart)**

**Glucagon IM**
- Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide

---

#### Organophosphate OD with S.L.U.D.G.E.

**Atropine IV/IO**
- Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide

---

### Fluid Resuscitation

**If poor perfusion or shock (Refer to age dependent chart):**

**Normal Saline bolus IV/IO**
- Use PEDIATAPE and refer to dosing guide
- May repeat to age dependent goal SBP

#### Age Dependent SBP for Signs of Shock:

- **Neonate:** < 60mmHg or weak pulses
- **Infant:** < 70mmHg or weak pulses
- **1-10 years:** < 70mmHg + (age in years x2)
- **Over 10 years:** <90mmHg

### Additional Considerations

**Consider contacting the California Poison Control Center for guidance**

*(Advisory ONLY)*

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearl

- Do not rely on patient history of ingestion, especially in suicide attempts. Make sure the patient is still not carrying other medications or weapons. Bring bottles, contents, and emesis to ED.
