## Treatment Protocol

**Enter from Pediatric Cardiac Arrest TG**

### Continue Ventilation via BVM

**With appropriate compression/ventilatory ratio**
- **Avoid hyperventilation**

### Establish IO/IV

### Reversible Causes

- Hypovolemia
- Hypoxia
- Hydrogen ion (acidosis)
- Hypothermia
- Hypo/Hyperkalemia
- Hypoglycemia
- Tension pneumothorax
- Tamponade (cardiac)
- Toxins
- Thrombosis (pulmonary)(PE)
- Thrombosis (coronary)(MI)

### First Defibrillation

**Defibrillation**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

**Resume chest compressions**
- Change compressors every 2 minutes (Limit changes/pulses checks < 5 seconds)

### Epinephrine Administration

**Epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml) IO/IV**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
- Repeat every 4 minutes
- 1st dose ASAP â€“ preferably within 5 minutes from initiation of CPR

**Do not interrupt Chest Compressions to administer medications**

### Subsequent Defibrillations

**Defibrillation**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

**Resume chest compressions**
- Change compressors every 2 minutes (Limit changes/pulses checks < 5 seconds)

### Amiodarone Administration

**Amiodarone IO/IV**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide
- May repeat up to 2 times for refractory Vfib/Pulseless V-Tach
- Maximum 300mg

**Defibrillation**
- Use Pediatape and refer to dosing guide

**Resume chest compressions**
- Change compressors every 2 minutes (Limit changes/pulses checks < 5 seconds)

### Refractory VF Assessment

**VF arrest resistant to three (3) shocks (refractory VF)?**

**If Yes:**
- **Initiate Transport**

### Rhythm Assessment

**Non-shockable Rhythm?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Pediatric Asystole/PEA TG**

### ROSC Assessment

**ROSC?**

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Pediatric Post Resuscitation TG**

**If No:**
- Continue resuscitation cycle

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

- Efforts should be directed at high quality chest compressions with limited interruptions and early defibrillation when indicated. Compress 1.5 inches in infants and 2 inches in children. Consider early IO placement if available or direct IV access if anticipated.

- Airway is a more important intervention in pediatric arrests. This should be accomplished quickly with a BVM. Patient survival is often dependent on proper ventilation and oxygenation with airway intervention.

- In order to be successful in pediatric arrests, a cause must be identified and corrected.

- Respiratory arrest is a common cause of cardiac arrest. Unlike adults, early ventilation intervention is critical.

- In most cases, pediatric airways can be managed by basic intervention with a BVM.

- DO NOT HYPERVENTILATE.

- Use a metronome during chest compression to ensure proper rate.

- Reassess and document ETT placement (patients above 40kg) and EtCO2 frequently, after every move, and at transfer of care.

- Do not stop chest compressions to check for placement of ETT or to give medications.
