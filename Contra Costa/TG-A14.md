---

## Treatment Protocol

### Position of Comfort

### Apply Cold Pack if Applicable

### Assess Pain Severity

**Use combination of pain scale, circumstances, MOI, injury, or illness severity**

### Moderate to Severe Pain?

#### If No:
- **Reassess BLS measures**
- Monitor and reassess

#### If Yes:

**Consider IV/IO**

---

### Pain Medication Options

#### Option 1: Fentanyl

**Fentanyl 25 – 50mcg IV/IO**
- Titrated in 25 – 50mcg increments to pain relief
- Consider 25mcg increments in elderly patients
- **Maximum of 200mcg total**

**If no IV access:**
- **Fentanyl 100mcg IN**
  - May repeat once after 15 minutes
- **Fentanyl 50 – 100mcg IM**
  - If no IV access and IN route not advisable
  - May repeat once after 15 minutes

**Monitor and reassess every 5 minutes following administration**

---

#### Option 2: Ketamine

**Ketamine IV/IO**
- 500mg/10ml = 50mg/ml

| Weight | Dose | Volume |
|--------|------|--------|
| 50-69 kg | 15mg | 0.3 ml |
| 70-89 kg | 20mg | 0.4 ml |
| 90+ kg | 30mg | 0.6 ml |

- Draw in a tuberculin syringe and dilute dose in 10 ml or 100 ml NS for infusion slowly over 5 minutes
- **Single dose only**

**Monitor and reassess every 5 minutes following administration**

---

#### Option 3: Acetaminophen

**Consider for longer acting relief:**

**Acetaminophen 1g IV/IO infusion over 15 minutes**
- **Single dose only**

**Monitor and reassess every 5 minutes following administration**

---

### Additional Acetaminophen for Severe Pain

**Acetaminophen 1g IV/IO infusion over 15 minutes**
- May be administered once in addition to Fentanyl or Ketamine for patients with severe pain
- **Single dose only**

**Monitor and reassess every 5 minutes following administration**

---

### Base Hospital Contact

**Contact Base Hospital for co-administration of Ketamine and Fentanyl or for additional medication orders**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction as needed

---

## Pearls

- Pain severity (0 – 10 scale) is a vital sign to be recorded before and after all BLS pain control measures and ALS pain medication delivery. Monitor blood pressure and respirations closely as pain control medications may cause hypotension or respiratory distress.

- Patients may display a wide variation of response to opioid pain medication (Fentanyl). Consider the patient's age, weight, clinical condition, other recent drugs, or alcohol and prior exposure to opiates when determining initial dosing. Minimal doses of opioids may cause respiratory depression in the elderly or those patients who weigh less.

- For patients who have a tolerance to opioids, non-narcotic therapies may be appropriate until evaluation at the receiving facility.

- Acetaminophen may be administered once in addition to Fentanyl or Ketamine for patients with severe pain.

- Have Naloxone available to reverse respiratory depression due to Fentanyl, should it occur.

- USE EXTREME CAUTION when administering opioids together with benzodiazepines; this combination results in a deeper level of anesthesia with a significant risk for airway and respiratory compromise.

- Do not administer Acetaminophen to patients with severe liver impairment or active liver disease.

### Contraindications of Fentanyl and Ketamine include:

- Closed head injury
- Altered level of consciousness
- Headache
- Hypotension (BP < 90)
- Respiratory failure/worsening status
- Childbirth/suspected active labor

### Burn Patients

**Burn patients may require higher than usual opioid doses to achieve adequate pain control. IF A PATIENT HAS SUFFERED BURNS THAT REQUIRE TRANSPORT TO A BURN CENTER, THE PATIENT MAY REQUIRE MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM TOTAL DOSE OF FENTANYL OR KETAMINE TO ACHIEVE PAIN CONTROL. CONTACT THE BASE HOSPITAL FOR ADDITIONAL ORDERS.**
