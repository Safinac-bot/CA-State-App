2. Patient presents with syncope, ROSC, abdominal pain or indications of suspected cardiac involvement.

## Procedure

1. Prepare ECG monitor and connect patient cable with electrodes.

2. Enter the required patient information: age, gender, incident number and patient's first and last initials into the ECG monitor.

3. Expose chest and prep as necessary (e.g. shaving). Modesty of the patient should be respected.

4. **Apply chest leads and extremity leads using the following landmarks:**
   - **V1** – 4th intercostal space at right sternal border
   - **V2** – 4th intercostal space at left sternal border
   - **V3** – Directly between V2 and V4
   - **V4** – 5th intercostal space at midclavicular line
   - **V5** – Level with V4 at left anterior axillary line
   - **V6** – Level with V5 at left midaxillary line

5. Instruct the patient to remain still.

6. Acquire the 12-Lead ECG.

7. If the monitor detects signal noise (such as patient motion or a disconnected electrode), the 12-Lead acquisition may be interrupted until the noise is resolved.

8. Once acquired, as soon as possible, transmit 12-lead ECG.

9. If computerized interpretation indicates **\*\*\*ST ELEVATION MI CRITERIA\*\*\*** or the ECG is interpreted as showing STEMI based on paramedic judgement, the patient is to be transported to the nearest STEMI Receiving Center.

10. Contact the STEMI Receiving Center as soon as feasible to notify them of a STEMI Alert and that a STEMI positive 12-Lead ECG has been transmitted to their facility.

11. Download the cardiac monitor data as required by EMS policy and attach a copy of the 12-Lead ECG to the prehospital EHR.

12. Document in the prehospital EHR: the 12-Lead procedure time, the ECG results, and the time of transmission to the STEMI Receiving Center for a STEMI positive ECG.
