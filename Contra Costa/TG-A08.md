# Treatment Guideline A08
## Hyperkalemia

**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective Date:** January 2024  
**Page:** 1 of 2

---

## History

- Peritoneal or hemodialysis
- Anemia
- Peripheral dialysis access (e.g. catheter, shunt, graft, or fistula)
- Hyperkalemia

## Differential

- Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
- Pericarditis
- Diabetic emergency
- Sepsis
- Cardiac tamponade
- Cardiac Dysrhythmia
- Other electrolyte derangement
- Medication Overdose (e.g. TCA/anticholinergic, beta blocker, or calcium channel blocker)

## Signs and Symptoms

- ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia
- Weakness/Fatigue
- Nausea/Vomiting
- Chest pain
- Palpitations
- Shortness of breath
- Numbness/Tingling

## Treatment Protocol

### Cardiac Monitor

### 12-Lead ECG

### Establish IV/IO

### ECG Assessment

**Symptomatic with ECG progressing at/or past Widened QRS?**

#### ECG Progression in Hyperkalemia

1. Peaked T Waves
2. Flattened or absent P Waves
3. Widened QRS (≥ 0.12) with or without bradycardia
4. Sine-wave
5. Ventricular Fibrillation or Asystole

#### If No (Not progressed to widened QRS):
- Monitor and transport

#### If Yes (Widened QRS or beyond):

1. **Calcium Chloride 1 gm over 2-3 minutes**
   - 20ml flush IV/IO prior to pushing next med

2. **Sodium Bicarbonate 50 mEq IV/IO**
   - 20ml flush IV/IO prior to pushing next med

3. **Albuterol continuous nebulizer 5mg in 6ml to a total of 20 mg**

4. **If systolic blood pressure is < 90:**
   - Normal Saline bolus 500ml
   - Repeat to goal SBP > 90
   - Maximum 1L

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Pearls

### Cautions:

- Albuterol may exacerbate tachycardia in patients with hyperkalemia.
- Sodium Bicarbonate may exacerbate volume overload.
- Mixing Sodium Bicarbonate and Calcium Chloride will create a precipitate in the IV. Consider using separate lines or use a normal saline flush between administration of these medications.

### Clinical Considerations:

- Hyperkalemia is common in patients with severe renal failure (particularly those on dialysis) and should be suspected when these patients have weakness/fatigue, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, or numbness/tingling.

- For the dialysis patient whose peripheral access site (fistula/graft) has already been accessed, the existing IV line may be used by a paramedic for administration of fluids or medications if attempts at an IV and IO access have failed.

- The common initial ECG changes seen in hyperkalemia are changes in the T wave. The T wave appears tall and peaked and is best seen in inferior leads (Lead II and Lead III). As the potassium level continues to climb, the QRS starts to widen. Finally, as the potassium level climbs to a point when the P waves start to disappear and the QRS starts to flatten into a sine wave configuration, cardiac output has dropped precipitously, and the patient is at risk for ventricular fibrillation or asystole.

- Treatment in the prehospital setting should be based on the severity of the ECG and the stability of the patient. Treatment is intended to stabilize patients with the potential to arrest or become progressively unstable. When considering treatment, assess for widened QRS (≥ 0.12 seconds), hypoperfusion, and hypotension.

- **Do not take blood pressure or start an IV in extremity that has a fistula.**
