# VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES

Effective Jan. 2025

---

## HISTORY

- Dispatch information about VAD at the location
- VAD Patient
- DNR/POLST

---

## DIFFERENTIAL

- Device failure
- Asymptomatic dysrhythmias

---

## SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

**VAD patient with:**
- Signs of shock
- Difficulty breathing
- In cardiac arrest

---

## ALGORITHM

### ASSESS THE PATIENT

**There may be no palpable pulse, utilize other parameters for patient assessment (e.g., LOC, skin signs, capillary refill and EtCO₂).**

---

### Device Information

**Device information, implant center, and VAD Coordinator contact number may be located on:**
- The device itself
- On the refrigerator
- Medical alert bracelet

**If a caregiver is present, yield to their advice**

**The VAD Coordinator can assist you with determining the best course of action regarding assessment of the device**

> **Only the Base Hospital is authorized to provide medical direction**

---

### Decision Point 1: Cardiac arrest or if patient is unresponsive and the VAD is functioning?

**Yes** → **Begin continuous chest compressions**

→ **Exit to Cardiac Arrest TGs**

**No** → Continue to Assessment

---

## ASSESS THE DEVICE

### Check Device Power

**For continuous flow devices (no palpable pulse):**
- Auscultate the left upper quadrant of abdomen and listen for the "hum" of the device

**Determine if the device has power:**
- If the device has power, it does not necessarily mean it is working properly
- If the device has power, you will see a green light on the Heartmate II, the most common device
- On the HeartWare device, the display will tell you the liters per minute of blood flow

**Check the device for secure connections and properly charged batteries**

---

### Decision Point 2: Is the pump functioning?

**No** → Contact Base Hospital for direction

**Yes** → Continue to Clinical Assessment

---

## CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

### Decision Point 3: Is the patient's complaint unrelated to the VAD?

---

### Minor medical or trauma with adequate perfusion?

**Yes** → **Transport the patient to their Bay Area VAD Center**

**No** → Continue to specialty assessment

---

### Suspected trauma patients?

**Yes** → **Exit to Trauma TGs**

**No** → Continue assessment

---

### Suspected STEMI patients?

**Yes** → **Exit to Suspected STEMI TG**

**No** → Continue assessment

---

### Suspected stroke patients?

**Yes** → **Exit to Suspected Stroke TG**

**No** → Transport to VAD Center

---

## BAY AREA VAD CENTERS

- Stanford – Palo Alto
- Lucille Packard – Palo Alto
- California Pacific Med. Ctr. – SF
- UC San Francisco – SF
- Kaiser Santa Clara – Santa Clara
- UC Davis - Davis

---

## VAD CENTER 24-HOUR HOTLINE

| VAD Center | Phone Number |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Stanford Hospital<br>Lucille Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford*** | (650) 723-6661 |
| **UC San Francisco** | (415) 443-5823<br>Pager |
| **Kaiser Santa Clara** | (408) 851-3750 |
| **UC Davis** | (916) 734-2020 |

**Stanford Hospital and Lucille Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford share the same VAD Coordinators*

---

## TRANSPORT

**Notify receiving facility.**

**Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed.**

---

## PEARLS

- Patients may be cardioverted or defibrillated if symptomatic, but asymptomatic dysrhythmias do not require treatment.

- Consider contacting the Base Hospital if there are questions concerning destination choices.

- If possible, the patient's family member or caregiver should accompany the patient in the ambulance, and all related VAD equipment, including spare batteries, should also be transported with the patient.

- In arrest situations, a POLST/DNR or advanced directive may be available. Many VAD patients have made end of life care decisions.
