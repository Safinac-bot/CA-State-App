## Pearls

- **USE EXTREME CAUTION in administering pain medication to patients less than 10kg.**

- This treatment guideline applies to patients < 15 years of age and who can be measured on a PediaTape. If a patient is larger than a PediaTape, you may use the Adult Pain Control Treatment Guideline.

- Pain severity (0 â€“ 10 scale or Wong-Baker faces scale) is a vital sign to be recorded before and after all BLS pain control measures and ALS pain medication delivery. Monitor blood pressure and respirations closely as pain control medications may cause hypotension or respiratory distress.

### Contraindications of Fentanyl include:

- Closed head injury
- Altered level of consciousness
- Headache
- Hypotension
- Respiratory failure/worsening status
- Childbirth/suspected active labor

#### Hypotension Criteria:

- Neonate: < 60mmHg or weak pulses
- Infant: < 70mmHg or weak pulses
- 1-10 years: < 70mmHg + (age in years x2)
- Over 10 years: <90mmHg

### Additional Considerations:

- Have Naloxone available to reverse respiratory depression should it occur.

- **Burn patients may require higher than usual opioid doses to achieve adequate pain control. IF A PATIENT HAS SUFFERED BURNS THAT REQUIRE TRANSPORT TO A BURN CENTER, THE PATIENT MAY REQUIRE MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM TOTAL DOSE OF FENTANYL TO ACHIEVE PAIN CONTROL. CONTACT THE BASE HOSPITAL FOR ADDITIONAL ORDERS.**
