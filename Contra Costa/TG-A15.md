## Pearls

- Always talk to family/caregivers as they have specific knowledge of the patient's device(s).

- Try to use patient's equipment if available and functioning properly.

- Estimate suction catheter size by doubling the inner tracheostomy tube diameter and rounding down.

- **Suction depth:** Ask family or caregiver. Suction no more than 3-6cm. Introduce 2-3ml NS before suctioning.

- You shouldn't suction for more than 10 seconds with each attempt and pre-oxygenate before and between attempts.

- DO NOT force the suction catheter. If unable to pass, the tracheostomy tube should be changed.

- Always deflate tracheal tube cuff before removal. Use continuous pulse oximetry and EtCO2 monitoring.

- Use extreme caution when placing an ETT into a stoma. Placing the ETT too deep will result in right main stem positioning.
