# Field Procedure FP02
## Airway: BLS Management

## Clinical Indications

1. A patient who is unable to maintain their airway without assistance.

## Procedure

### 1. Position the Patient

**Position the patient to optimize airway opening and facilitate ventilations.**

- **Use the sniffing position** with head extended (A) and neck flexed forward (B) unless there is a suspected spinal injury.

- **Position with head/shoulders elevated:** anterior ear should be at the same horizontal level as the sternal notch (C). This is especially advantageous in larger or morbidly obese patients.

### 2. Two-Person BVM Technique

**Using a two-person technique is the preferred method to ventilate patients with a Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM).**

**J-A-W-S:**

- **J** – Jaw thrust maneuver to open the airway.

- **A** – Use a nasal or oral airway. Appropriately measure before placing airway adjunct.

- **W** – Work together to ventilate the patient using a BVM. This should be done using two rescuers – one holding the mask to achieve an optimal seal and the other to deliver ventilations.

- **S** – Slow and small ventilations to produce visible chest rise.

### 3. Continuous Monitoring

**It is required that the airway be monitored continuously through:**
- Waveform capnography (ALS providers)
- Pulse oximetry

## Notes

1. The goal of airway management is to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Initial airway management should always begin with BLS maneuvers.

2. **Avoid excessive ventilation.** In non-arrest patients, ventilation rates should be:
   - **Adults** – 10/minute
   - **Children** – 20/minute
   - **Infants** – 30/minute
