## Pearls

- Family and/or caregivers might have specific knowledge and skills of device(s).

- If hemodynamically unstable and a peripheral IV or IO cannot be obtained, access to the central catheter may be utilized for definitive care if device is functioning properly.

- Central venous access devices that require the penetration of skin, such as internal subcutaneous infusion ports, may not be used.

- Sterile techniques should be utilized when accessing/manipulating a dialysis catheter device.

- Avoid placing a tourniquet or BP cuff on the same side as a PICC line.

- If an occlusion is evident, do not attempt to force the catheter open.

- Consult family and/or caregiver to determine if it is appropriate to stop or change an infusion.
