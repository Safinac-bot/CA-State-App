## Treatment Protocol

### Oxygen via Blow By or Normal Mask

**Oxygen via blow by or normal mask with goal of Oxygen saturation â‰¥ 94% SpO2**

### Cardiac Monitor

### EtCO2 Monitoring

### Airway Assessment

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Pediatric Airway TG**

**If No:**
- Continue assessment

### Allergic Reaction Assessment

## Pearls

- All respiratory patients must have continuous pulse oximetry and waveform capnography (EtCO2).

- Do not force a child into a position; allow them to assume a position of comfort.

- **Bronchiolitis** is a viral infection typically affecting infants which results in wheezing that may not respond to Albuterol.

- **Croup** is a viral infection affecting children > 2 years of age. Symptoms may include fever, gradual onset, and without drooling.

- **Epiglottitis** is a bacterial infection affecting children > 2 years of age. Symptoms may include fever, rapid onset, and the need to sit up. Drooling is common. Airway manipulation may worsen condition.
