## Pearls

- BRUE is formally diagnosed in the ED only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after a physician conducts an appropriate history and physical examination.

- Always consider non-accidental trauma in any infant who presents with BRUE.

- It is important to document sleeping position as parent co-sleeping is associated with infant deaths.
