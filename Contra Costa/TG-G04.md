# FEVER/INFECTION CONTROL

Effective Jan. 2021

---

## HISTORY

- Age
- Duration of fever
- Severity of fever
- Past medical history
- Medications
- Immunocompromised (transplant, HIV, diabetes, cancer)
- Environmental exposure
- Recent travel to emerging infectious disease affected regions
- Time of last Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen

---

## DIFFERENTIAL

- Infections/sepsis
- Cancer/tumors/lymphomas
- Medication or drug reaction
- Connective tissue disease
  - Arthritis
  - Vasculitis
- Hyperthyroidism
- Heat stroke
- Meningitis or other airborne disease
- Emerging infectious disease

---

## SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

- Warm
- Flushed appearance
- Sweaty
- Chills

### Associated symptoms (helpful to localize source)

- Myalgia, cough, chest pain, headache, dysuria, abdominal pain, mental status changes, rash

---

## ALGORITHM

**Consider universal, contact, droplet, and airborne precautions**

---

### Decision Point 1: Suspect communicable disease requiring isolation?

**Yes** → **Obtain a thorough history of any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts and follow any/all current EMS system guidance based on the history**

→ **Notify receiving facility that isolation facilities will be required**

**No** → Continue to Decision Point 2

---

### Decision Point 2: Sepsis suspected?

---

## SEPSIS INDICATORS

**Obvious or suspected infection AND any TWO of the following criteria:**

- Respiratory rate ≥ 20
- Temperature > 100.4° or < 96.8°
- Heart Rate > 90

---

**Yes** → **Exit to Suspected Sepsis TG**

**No** → **Exit to appropriate TG**

---

## ADDITIONAL CARE

**Consider IV/IO**

---

## PEARLS

- **Febrile seizures** are more likely in children with a history of febrile seizures and may be caused by a rapid elevation in temperature.

- **All-hazards precautions** include standard PPE plus airborne and contact precautions. This level of precaution is utilized during the initial phase of an outbreak when the etiology of the infection is unknown or when the causative agent is found to be highly contagious (e.g. Ebola, MERS, SARS, COVID).

- **Droplet precautions** include standard PPE plus a standard surgical mask for providers who accompany patients in the back of the ambulance and a surgical mask or NRB O₂ mask for the patient. This level of precaution should be utilized when influenza, meningitis, mumps, streptococcal pharyngitis and other illnesses spread via large particle droplets are suspected. A patient with a potentially infectious rash should be treated with droplet precautions.

- **Contact precautions** include standard PPE plus utilization of a gown, change of gloves after every patient contact, and strict hand washing precautions. This level of precaution is utilized when multi-drug resistant organisms (e.g. MRSA and VRE), scabies, herpes zoster (shingles), or other illnesses spread by contact are suspected.

- **Rehydration with fluids** increases the patient's ability to sweat and improves temperature control.
