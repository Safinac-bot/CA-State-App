## Pearls

- After delivery, massaging the uterus (lower abdomen) will promote uterine contraction and help to control post partum bleeding.

- Some perineal bleeding is normal with any childbirth. Large quantities of blood or free bleeding are abnormal.

- **Document the following information during care in childbirth:**
  - Para/gravida
  - Contraction frequency and length
  - Time of delivery
  - Time cord was cut
  - Name of the prehospital provider who cut the cord
