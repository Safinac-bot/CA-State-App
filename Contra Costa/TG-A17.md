**Contra Costa County Emergency Medical Services**  
**Effective Date:** January 2021  
**Page:** 1 of 2

## History

- Presence and duration of fever
- Previously documented infection or illness (UTI, pneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis, cellulitis, or abscess)
- Recent surgery or invasive procedure
- Immunocompromised
- Bedridden or immobile
- Prosthetic or indwelling devices

## Differential

- Shock (hypovolemic or cardiogenic)
- Dehydration
- Hyperthyroidism
- Medication or drug interaction
- Non-septic infection
- Allergic reaction or anaphylaxis
- Toxicological emergency

## Signs and Symptoms

- Hyper or hypothermia
- Rash or excessive bruising
- Chills
- Myalgia
- Markedly decreased urine output
- AMS
- Delayed capillary refill
- Elevated blood glucose (unless diabetic)

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Consider Appropriate PPE and Infection Control Measures

### EtCO2 Monitoring

### Cardiac Monitor

### Septic Patient Assessment

**Septic Patient?**

**Obvious or suspected infection AND any TWO of the following criteria:**
- Respiratory rate ≥ 20
- Temperature > 100.4° or < 96.8°
- Heart Rate > 90

#### If No:
- Continue routine care

#### If Yes:

**Establish IV/IO**

### SBP < 90 and/or Signs of Shock?

#### If No:

**Start Normal Saline 500mL bolus IV/IO**
- Repeat 500 mL bolus to Maximum of 1L
- Discontinue if signs of fluid overload develop
- *See Pearls*

---

#### If Yes:

1. **Start Normal Saline 500mL bolus IV/IO**
   - Repeat 500 mL bolus to Maximum of 2L
   - Discontinue if signs of fluid overload develop
   - *See Pearls*

2. **Make SEPSIS ALERT notification**

3. **Consider Base contact for Push Dose Epi in patients with severe hypotension refractory to fluid bolus**
   - See drug reference
   - Contact Base Hospital Physician for additional order

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

---

## Pearls

- Sepsis is more common in the very young and elderly.

- Early recognition of sepsis allows for attentive care and early administration of antibiotics.

- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is an ominous, late stage manifestation of sepsis characterized by frank, extensive bruising, bleeding from multiple sites, and finally tissue death.

- **Aggressive IV fluid therapy is the most important prehospital treatment for sepsis.** Suspected sepsis patients should receive repeated fluid boluses (to a Maximum of 2L). Reassess every 500 ml for signs of pulmonary edema, especially in patients with a known history of CHF or ESRD on dialysis. STOP fluid administration with signs of pulmonary edema.

- Septic patients are especially susceptible to traumatic lung injury and ARDS. If artificial ventilation is necessary, avoid ventilating with excessive tidal volumes. Use only enough tidal volume to see the chest rise. If CPAP is utilized, airway pressure should be limited to 7.5cm H2O if using a rate adjustable device.

- Attempt to identify source of infection (e.g. skin, respiratory, etc.) and relay previous treatments and related history to receiving ED physician.
