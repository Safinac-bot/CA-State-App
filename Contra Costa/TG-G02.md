## PEARLS

- Patients who have been deemed terminally ill by two independent physicians have the right under the California End of Life Act to end their life with dignity at a time that they choose themselves. EMS personnel should be aware of and familiar with this act. Refer to Policy 1003 for additional information.

- Naloxone will not have an affect on the drugs prescribed for death with dignity patients and is not advised.

- It is important to recognize that families may be educated on what to expect with a dying family member, but no amount of preparation can eliminate the stress and grief of watching a loved one die.

- Contact the Base Hospital for direction or assistance with family if necessary.
