## History

- Ingestion or suspected ingestion of a potentially toxic substance
- Substance ingested, route, and quantity
- Time of ingestion
- Reason (suicidal, accidental or criminal)
- Past medical history and medications

## Differential

- Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
- Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
- Aspirin
- Depressants
- Stimulants
- Anticholinergics
- Cardiac medications (calcium channel blockers, beta blockers)
- Solvents, alcohols or cleaning agents
- Insecticides (organophosphates)

## Signs and Symptoms

- Mental status changes
- Hypo or hypertension
- Decreased respiratory rate
- Tachycardia or dysrhythmias
- Seizures
- S.L.U.D.G.E.

## Treatment Protocol

### Administer Oxygen with Goal of ≥ 94% SpO2

### Consider IV/IO

### Cardiac Monitor

### Consider 12-Lead ECG

### Suspected Opioid OD?

**If Yes:**
- **Exit to Opioid Overdose TG as indicated**

### Specific Overdose Management

#### Tricyclic Antidepressant or Anticholinergic OD
**(e.g. massive Benadryl OD) with QRS ≥ 0.12 AND SBP < 90**

**Sodium Bicarbonate 50 mEq IV/IO**
- May repeat in 5-10 minutes if needed

**If SBP < 90 consider:**
- Normal Saline bolus 500ml IV/IO
- Maximum 1L

---

#### Beta Blocker or Calcium Channel Blocker OD
**With HR < 50 and SBP < 90**

**Glucagon 1mg IM**

**If SBP < 90 consider:**
- Normal Saline bolus 500ml IV/IO
- Maximum 1L

---

#### Organophosphate OD with S.L.U.D.G.E

**Atropine 1-2mg IV/IO**
- Repeat every 3-5 minutes until relief of symptoms achieved

---

#### Hydrofluoric Acid Exposure

**Calcium Chloride 500mg IV/IO (5ml of 10% solution)**
- For tetany or cardiac arrest

---

#### Antipsychotic OD with Dystonic Reaction

**Exit to Dystonic Reaction TG**

---

### Additional Considerations

- **Consider pain control in the absence of age-specific hypotension, poor perfusion, or ALOC**

- **Consider contacting the California Poison Control Center for guidance**

**California Poison Control Center: (800) 222-1222**

### Notification

- Notify receiving facility
- Contact Base Hospital for medical direction, as needed

## Common Toxidromes

| Toxidrome | Vital Signs | Mental Status | Other Findings | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Anticholinergic** | Hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea | Hypervigilant, agitated, hallucinating | Dry flushed skin, urinary retention | Antihistamines, TCAs, atropine, scopolamine, antispasmodics |
| **Cholinergic** | Bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension | Confused, coma | S.L.U.D.G.E. | Organophosphate, pesticides, nerve agents, physostigmine |
| **Hallucinogen** | Hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension | Hallucination, synesthesia, agitation | Nystagmus | PCP, LSD, mescaline |
| **Opioid** | Hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, bradypnea | CNS depression, coma | Hyporeflexia, pulmonary edema | Fentanyl, heroin, morphine, methadone, oxycodone |
| **Sedative-hypnotic** | Hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, bradypnea | CNS depression, confusion, coma | Hyporeflexia | Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol |
| **Serotonin Syndrome** | Hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea | Confused, agitated, coma | Tremor, myoclonus, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, trismus, rigidity | MAOIs, SSRIs, meperidine, dextromethorphan |
| **Sympathomimetic** | Hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea | Agitated, hyperalert, paranoia | Diaphoresis, tremors, hyperreflexia, seizures | Cocaine, amphetamines, pseudoephedrine |

## Pearls

- Overdose or toxic ingestion patients with significant ingestion/exposures should be monitored very closely and aggressively treated as indicated. Do not hesitate to contact the Base Hospital for advice as certain critically ill overdose patients may quickly overwhelm medication supplies. For example, a tricyclic overdose with a wide QRS and altered mental status may need to receive multiple Sodium Bicarbonate boluses until QRS narrowing and clinical improvement; patients with organophosphate toxicity with SLUDGE syndrome may require more Atropine than is usually available on an ambulance.

- Suicide attempt patients may not be reliable historians. Be careful with patient's account of ingestion, and make sure patient is not carrying any weapons or other medications. Consider Law Enforcement to assist.

- Medication bottles, contents, and emesis should be brought to the Emergency Department. They may assist with identification.

- **S.L.U.D.G.E.** - Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, GI distress, and Emesis.
