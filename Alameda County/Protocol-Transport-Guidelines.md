TRANSPORT GUIDELINES

Note: In addition, see "Trauma Patient Criteria" page 26, "Burn Patient Criteria" page 9, "Stroke / CVA" page 56, "Chest Pain/MI" page 39, and "12-lead ECG" page 120 for specific transport instructions.

1. GENERAL TRANSPORT GUIDELINES: All patients who wish to be transported by ambulance to the hospital should be transported

1.1 Patient Destination:

1.1.1 Patients should be transported to the closest hospital appropriate for their medical needs within a reasonable transport time or as specified in the patient care protocols

1.1.2 In general, patients should be transported to the hospital choice of the patient and/or family, if allowed by the protocols, and if there is no compelling reason to take them somewhere else

1.1.3 Paramedics should contact the Base Physician for any questions regarding transport destinations. If the Base Hospital is contacted for medical direction, the ultimate responsibility for determining patient destination will rest with the Base Hospital Physician

2. TRANSPORT DECISIONS: Transport decision should be based on paramedic judgment. Paramedics should take the following into consideration before transport:

2.1 Patient condition or ability of field personnel to provide field stabilization and/or emergency intervention. TRANSPORT OF ACUTE PATIENTS: Any patient with an acute, unstable appearance and/or severe symptoms may be transported Code 3 (lights and siren). Code 3 transport (lights and siren) has significant, inherent risks for the public and the patient. If Code 3 transport of an acute patient does NOT significantly decrease transport time to the hospital, the acute patient should be transported Code 2 (no lights and siren). The hospital must be notified of the patient's Code 3 acuity even if transported Code 2

2.2 Scene assessment and/or potential extrication difficulties

2.3 ETA to the destination facility including traffic delays

2.4 Instructions within specific algorithms to "initiate early transport"

2.5 Hospital diversion status - See "Ambulance Rerouting" page vi

2.6 Recommendation from a physician familiar with the patient's current condition, or the patient's regular source of hospitalization/healthcare. For physician on-scene - see page 104

2.7 Hospitals with specialized services (e.g.: trauma center, burn center, STEMI Center (SRC), etc.)

3. TRANSFER OF CARE: Any paramedic level personnel may transfer care of a BLS patient to any EMT as long as the care required by the patient is within the scope of practice of an EMT, and the patient has no injury or illness that requires or is likely to require monitoring or treatment by an ALS provider

4. RECEIVING HOSPITAL NOTIFICATION: Transport units should contact the receiving hospital prior to arrival with the patient's chief complaint, a summary of treatment given and the ETA.

5. OUT OF COUNTY TRANSPORTS:

5.1 Patients may be transported to hospitals outside Alameda County if the out-of-county hospital is the closest most appropriate hospital for the medical needs of the patient. Base contact is not required but should be attempted if there are any questions regarding the transport

5.2 Contact the receiving facility by radio or landline. If unable, contact the appropriate dispatch agency to relay information to the receiving facility. This will provide information on bed availability. Do not transport patient to out-of-county hospital without obtaining prior authorization
