ANAPHYLAXIS / ALLERGIC REACTION

•Epinephrine IM is the cornerstone of treatment of anaphylaxis and should be given as early as possible. It is best absorbed from an injection in the lateral thigh
•If the patient is in severe distress, administer Epinephrine IM and consider immediate transport
•SIGNS OF ANAPHYLAXIS (Systemic Reaction) – wheezing, repetitive cough, tightness in chest, stridor, difficulty swallowing or tightness in throat, change in voice, dizziness or feeling faint, abdominal complaints (pain, repeated vomiting, diarrhea or incontinence), anxiety, lethargy
•SIGNS OF ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK – pallor, hypotension, cool, clammy mottled skin, altered sensorium
•Facial/oral swelling (Angioedema) can accompany anaphylaxis, but is not always present

NOTES:
* If patient develops signs of anaphylaxis, go to other arm of this algorithm
** In elderly, small, or in patients with mild symptoms or history of CAD, consider lower dose (0.3mg IM).
*** IV/IO epinephrine should only be used if symptoms are unresponsive to IM epinephrine and patient has signs of profound shock
§ Diphenhydramine may lessen discomfort from rash/itching but is not an essential treatment of anaphylaxis. Consider reduced dosage if patient has taken diphenhydramine in the past 1-2 hrs.
