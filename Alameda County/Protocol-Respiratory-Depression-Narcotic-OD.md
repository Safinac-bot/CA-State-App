RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION OR APNEA (SUSPECTED NARCOTIC OD)
Patient Care Policy (Adult)
Modified On: May 27, 2021

•Routine Medical Care
•Naloxone can cause acute withdrawal symptoms (agitation,vomiting, etc.) in patients who are chronic utilizers of narcotics
•Naloxone can cause cardiovascular side effects (chest pain, pulmonary edema) or seizures in a small number of patients (1-2%)
•Older patients are at higher risk for cardiovascular complications
•Patients who are maintaining adequate respirations with decreased level of consciousness do not generally require Naloxone for management

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Maintain airway patency and adequate respirations with BLS airway adjuncts and BVM as needed
Oxygen- titrate to SpO2 of 94-99%
Consider vascular access
↓
Respiratory rate ≤ 8

YES → Naloxone:
      IN/IM/IV- Initial dose: Titrated dose to maintain respiratory rate ≥ 8, up to 2 mg
      Repeat as needed to maintain respiratory rate ≥ 8 (no max. dose)
      
      BLS Providers may only utilize the IN administration route
      
      If patient is a known/suspected chronic utilizer of narcotics, consider 1:10 dilution of Naloxone:Normal Saline
      Administer in 0.1 mg (1 ml) increments to maintain respiratory rate ≥ 8
      ↓
      Monitor/Reassess
      ↓
      If BVM ventilation and Naloxone are ineffective,
      consider Advanced Airway placement (see page 108)

NO → Monitor/Reassess
