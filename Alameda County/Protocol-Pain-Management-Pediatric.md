Modified On: June 29, 2023

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care. If oxygen is administered, titrate to 94-99% SpO2
•Pain management should be initiated as early as possible and before transport in the stable patient. Consider pain management prior to the manipulation of suspected fractures
•The preferred route of administration is intranasal (IN)
•Use an LBRT to determine pediatric medication dosages - (Shown underlined on the algorithm)
