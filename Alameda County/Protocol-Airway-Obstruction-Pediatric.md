AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION

Modified On: May 10, 2019

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•If airway obstruction is caused by laryngeal trauma, see page 25 "Trauma Patient Care"
•Do not use a tongue/jaw lift or perform blind finger sweeps
•Obstruction due to suspected epiglottitis:
ÎDo not attempt to visualize the throat or insert anything into the mouth
ÎMinimize outside stimulation. Keep the patient calm. Position of comfort.
•Rapid Transport
•Note: Manage the patient's airway with proper airway positioning, simple airway adjuncts, suctioning, and BVM ventilation as necessary. Consider Advanced Airway Management (page 112) if BVM ventilation is not adequate.

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

*Severe signs of obstruction?

NO → Observe

YES ↓

Ask the patient "Are you choking"?
If patient nods yes, act

*Signs of severe obstruction
☐ Poor air exchange
☐ Increased breathing difficulty
☐ Silent cough
☐ Cyanosis
☐ Inability to speak or breathe

If the patient is < 1 year old:
- Deliver 5 back blows followed by 5 chest thrusts.

If the patient is > 1 year old:
- Apply abdominal thrusts in rapid sequence.
- If ineffective, consider chest thrusts.

If the patient becomes unresponsive:
Begin CPR
Check for F.B.
Only remove if seen in the pharynx

Assist Ventilation with Bag Valve Mask (see note)

Able to ventilate adequately?

YES → Maintain airway and Oxygen
      Transport to the closest ED

NO → Transport to the closest ED
