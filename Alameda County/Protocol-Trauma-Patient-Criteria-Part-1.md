Patient Care Policy (General)
Modified On: June 15, 2023

1. INTRODUCTION: The goal of the Alameda County trauma system is to transport confirmed patients meeting the various criteria below to a designated trauma center in a timely manner, bypassing non-trauma centers

2. RED CRITERIA TRAUMA PATIENTS (High Risk for Serious Injury):

2.1 A patient is identified as at high risk for serious injury when any of the following injury patterns or mental status/vitals signs listed below are present. These patients should be transported to a designated Trauma Center rapidly.

Injury Patterns:
• Penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso, and proximal extremities
• Skull deformity, suspected skull fracture
• Suspected spinal injury with new motor or sensory loss
• Chest wall instability, deformity, or suspected flail chest
• Suspected pelvic fracture
• Suspected fracture of two or more proximal long bones
• Crushed, degloved, mangled, or pulseless extremity
• Amputation proximal to wrist or ankle
• Active bleeding requiring a tourniquet or wound packing with continuous pressure

Mental Status & Vitals Signs:

All Patients:
• Total Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 13 or; Motor GCS < 6 (Unable to follow commands)
• RR < 10 or > 29 breaths/min
• Respiratory distress or need for respiratory support
• Room-air pulse oximetry < 90%

Age 0–9 years:
• SBP < 70mm Hg + (2 x age in years)

Age 10–64 years:
• SBP < 90 mmHg or
• HR > SBP

Age ≥ 65 years:
• SBP < 110 mmHg or
• HR > SBP

3. YELLOW CRITERIA TRAUMA PATIENTS (Moderate Risk for Serious Injury):

3.1 In addition to above criteria, the following mechanisms of injury and EMS provider judgment of risk factors can be utilized to preferentially triage a patient to a trauma center. In general, these patients are transported code 2, however, differing field circumstances and/or patient condition may require a code 3 transport

Mechanism of Injury:
• High-Risk Auto Crash
  – Partial or complete ejection
  – Significant intrusion (including roof)
    • >12 inches occupant site OR
    • >18 inches any site OR
    • Need for extrication for entrapped patient
  – Death in passenger compartment
  – Child (age 0–9 years) unrestrained or in unsecured child safety seat
  – Vehicle telemetry data consistent with severe injury
• Rider separated from transport vehicle with significant impact (eg, motorcycle, ATV, horse, etc.)
• Pedestrian/bicycle rider thrown, run over, or with significant impact
• Fall from height > 10 feet (all ages)

EMS Judgment:
Consider risk factors, including:
• Low-level falls in young children (age ≤ 5 years) or older adult (age ≥ 65 years) with significant head impact
• Anticoagulant use
• Suspicion of child abuse
• Special, high-resource healthcare needs
• Pregnancy > 20 weeks
• Burns in conjunction with trauma
• Children should be triaged preferentially to pediatric capable centers
• EMS Provider judgment - If concerned, take to a trauma center
