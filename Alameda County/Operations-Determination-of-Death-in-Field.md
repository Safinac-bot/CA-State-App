DETERMINATION OF DEATH IN THE FIELD

Operations
Modified On: January 1, 2025

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 BLS and ALS prehospital personnel are not required to initiate resuscitative measures in any of the following circumstances:

► Signs of obvious death are present:
ÎTotal decapitation
ÎTotal incineration
ÎTotal separation or destruction of the heart or brain
ÎDecomposition of body tissues
ÎIn cases of traumatic arrest, if the staging and extrication time (without resuscitation) exceeds 20 minutes

ALS clinicians only: For the signs below, an ECG reading of asystole in two or more leads must be observed for one minute in conjunction with these signs
ÎDependent pooling of blood resulting in skin discoloration indicating lividity
ÎRigidity throughout the entire body, including the limbs, indicating rigor mortis
● Isolated tightness in the jaw is not sufficient for determining rigor mortis

► During multi-casualty incidents (MCIs); follow MCI triage principles

► Presence of a signed Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order, or Physician Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), an approved medical medallion inscribed with the words, "Do Not Resuscitate- EMS", or family discretion criteria

ÎFamily discretion criteria:
•In the absence of a valid DNR/POLST directive, if an identifiable immediate family member or spouse requests no resuscitation, with the unanimous agreement of others present, resuscitation efforts may be withheld or ceased if already initiated

ÎCopies or original forms of the signed DNR/POLST directives are acceptable
•All forms require the patient's signature (or signature of appropriate surrogate) and the signature of the patient's physician to be valid

ÎFor additional DNR/POLST special considerations see Section 5 of this policy

1.2 If any doubt exists, begin CPR immediately, and continue resuscitation efforts until it is determined the patient has signs of obvious death, meets determination of death criteria as outlined in this policy, a valid DNR/POLST is presented, or family discretion criteria

1.3 Contacting base should be reserved for cases of determining death in situations not addressed by this policy

2. Determination of Death Criteria – Medical Arrest Resuscitation

2.1 In the absence of obvious death, an MCI, a valid DNR/POLST, or family discretion criteria, adult and pediatric medical arrest resuscitation efforts may be terminated by ALS prehospital personnel after resuscitation efforts have continued for at least 20 minutes, and all of the following are present:
ÎApnea
ÎNo palpable carotid or femoral pulse for 10 seconds
ÎECG reading of Asystole or PEA < 40 bpm
ÎETC02 < 20 mmHg; advanced airway preferred
ÎROSC never achieved (ROSC defined as consecutive 5 minutes of palpable pulses at any point)
ÎPatient has received ≤ 2 defibrillations
ÎHypothermia is not suspected as the cause of arrest

2.2 If any of the Determination of Death Criteria for Medical Arrest Resuscitation are not met, continue resuscitation and contact base hospital

3. Procedure After Determination of Death in the Field

3.1 Reference the Death in the Field – Grief Support guidelines

3.2 Request the coroner and local public safety agency and remain with the deceased until either agency arrives

3.3 The public safety agency with local jurisdiction is responsible for the deceased. The deceased's body may not be moved or disturbed until a disposition is determined by the Alameda County Coroner's Bureau

3.4 Complete an EHR and attach a one-minute ECG rhythm strip of the final cardiac rhythm in two leads

4. DNR/POLST Special Considerations

4.1 If the patient is in cardiac arrest, the DNR/POLST directive should be honored, and resuscitation withheld
ÎWhile family can reverse a DNR/POLST encouragement should be given to honor patient wishes

4.2 Correct identification of the patient is essential. After a good faith effort to identify the patient, the presumption should be that the identity is correct if proper documentation is present, and the circumstances are consistent. When available, a reliable witness may be used to identify the patient

4.3 If the patient is transported, a copy of the DNR/POLST directive should stay with the patient
ÎIf the patient arrests while in transit, do not start resuscitation. Continue transporting to the original destination

4.4 A copy of the DNR directive should be attached to the EHR. If a copy is unavailable, document the type of DNR directive, date the order was issued, and the name of the physician

4.5 If the patient's physician issued the DNR order verbally while on scene, document the name of the physician and have the physician sign the EHR

4.6 There are other valid forms of directives including Advanced Health Care Directive (AHCD), the California Natural Death Act, and living wills
ÎThe AHCD contains a "Health Care Instructions" section with the patient's resuscitation preferences

4.7 When a patient is not in cardiac arrest, has a DNR/POLST, and requests treatment, up to and including resuscitation, the request should be honored
