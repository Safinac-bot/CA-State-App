RESPONDING UNITS - CANCELING / UPGRADING / DOWNGRADING

1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES: In general, it is better to respond with more personnel and equipment than is needed and cancel excess assigned resources, than fail to dispatch appropriate personnel and equipment. First Responder and transport units should be dispatched in accordance with MPDS-based guidelines as approved by County EMS when there is a report of people who are ill or injured

2. CANCELING RESPONDING UNITS: Medical personnel first on the scene of an incident:

2.1 shall cancel a responding ambulance unit upon determination that, in the best judgment of the first responder, the incident does not involve an injury or illness. The ambulance should not be canceled if the patient is requesting care and transport, even if there is no apparent illness or injury

2.2 shall cancel the ambulance response if the patient meets the "Determination of Death" criteria or the patient has a valid Alameda County or California Medical Association (CMA) "Do Not Attempt Resuscitation" form (see "Death in the Field" page 92)

2.3 Ambulance personnel arriving first on the scene of a medical emergency shall cancel the First Responder/Law enforcement response only if assistance is not needed and a potential public safety risk does not exist at the emergency scene

3. UPGRADING RESPONDING UNITS: Medical personnel first on the scene of an incident should upgrade a responding unit to a "non-divertible" response status:

3.1 If it is determined by first on-scene medical personnel that the patient's illness/injury meets any of the time-sensitive conditions requiring expedited transport criteria below:

3.1.1 Patients found to be experiencing a STEMI by 12-lead ECG

3.1.2 Patients shown to have findings of an active CVA within the current time treatment window

3.1.3 Patients who meet "Trauma Patient Criteria" as defined on page 25 of this book

3.1.4 Patients who have significant compromise to their airway, breathing, circulation and/or vital signs

3.2 If a life-threatening scene safety issue(s) exists

4. DOWNGRADING RESPONDING UNITS: Medical personnel first on the scene of an incident:

4.1 shall reduce the responding resource(s) from Code 3 to Code 2 upon determination that, in the best judgment of the first medical personnel on-scene, the illness or injury is not immediately life threatening or that the difference in Code 3 and Code 2 response time would not likely have an impact on patient outcome.
