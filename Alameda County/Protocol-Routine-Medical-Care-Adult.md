ROUTINE MEDICAL CARE - ADULT
Patient Care Policy (Adult)
Modified On: May 10, 2019

1. DEFINITIONS:

Baseline vital signs:
Î Pulse rate
Î Blood pressure
Î Respiratory rate
Î Pulse Oximetry
Î Consider temperature

SAMPLE History:
S = Signs & symptoms
A = Allergies
M = Medications
P = Pertinent past history
L = Last oral intake
E = Events leading to the injury/illness

Adapted from Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured, 8th Edition

2. SCENE SIZE-UP:
Î Scene safety
Î Determine mechanism of injury | nature of illness
Î Determine number of patients
Î Request additional assistance
Î Substance isolation

3. INITIAL ASSESSMENT:
Î Form general impression of the patient
Î Assess mental status
Î Assess the airway
Î Assess breathing
Î Assess circulation
Î Identify priority patients

4. TRAUMA PATIENTS: Focused History and Physical Exam - Reconsider mechanism of injury

Significant Mechanism of Injury:
Î Rapid trauma assessment
Î Baseline vital signs
Î SAMPLE History
Î Transport
Î Detailed physical exam

No Significant Mechanism of Injury:
Î Focused assessment based on chief complaint
Î Baseline vital signs
Î SAMPLE History
Î Transport
Î Detailed physical exam

5. MEDICAL PATIENTS - Focused History and Physical Exam - Evaluate responsiveness

Responsive:
Î History of illness
Î SAMPLE history
Î Focused physical exam based on Chief complaint
Î Baseline vital signs
Î Re-evaluate transport decision
Î Detailed physical exam

Unresponsive:
Î Rapid medical assessment
Î Baseline vital signs
Î SAMPLE history
Î Re-evaluate transport decision
Î Detailed physical exam

6. ONGOING ASSESSMENT
Î Repeat initial vitals signs
Î Repeat focused assessment
Î Reassess vital signs
Î Reassess interventions

7. TREAT AS APPROPRIATE, WITHIN SCOPE OF PRACTICE (See specific treatment protocols)

7.1 Airway:
► Open airway – suction, as needed
► Head tilt / Chin lift or jaw thrust without head extension if C-spine injury suspected
► Oropharyngeal | Nasopharyngeal airway

7.2 Breathing:

7.2.1 Oxygen Administration:
► Administer O2 – titrate to 94-99% SpO2 appropriate to patient condition
► If there is a history of COPD, observe for respiratory depression and support respirations as needed. Do not withhold oxygen from a patient in distress because of a history of COPD
► The patient presents with signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema or severe respiratory distress, O2 should be initiated at 15L/minute by non-rebreather mask

7.2.2 Assist ventilation.

7.2.3 CPAP (see page 118)

7.2.4 ETI or SGA (see Advanced Airway Management see page 112)

7.3 Circulation:
► Initiate CPR, as needed.(see page 10)

7.4 Fluid Administration:
► Start an intravenous/intraosseous line as needed
► When IV access is needed, most of the time a saline lock is sufficient. Consider an IV line with Normal Saline when the patient may need to receive volume or when frequent IV meds are being given (e.g. - cardiac arrest)
► When starting an IV/IO/saline lock, use chlorhexidine as a skin prep. Label insertion site with "PREHOSPITAL IV – DATE AND TIME"

8. PATIENT POSITION

8.1 Conscious, no trauma, good gag reflex: Position of comfort

8.2 Depressed Level of Consciousness, no trauma, decreased gag reflex: Left lateral position

8.3 Trauma: Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR), as needed. (see Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR) Procedure page 134). Make sure the patient can be rolled to the side in the event of vomiting

8.4 Pregnancy: Do not lay the patient flat if more than 20 weeks pregnant. Transport either in semi-fowlers position or left lateral decubitus position. If patient requires SMR, secure to a backboard first then tilt the board 20 – 30 degrees to the left

8.5 Respiratory distress: Fowler's position or position of comfort

9. PATIENT MEDICATIONS

9.1 Field personnel must either bring all medication bottles with the patient to the hospital (preferred), or make a list of the medications, including the drug name, dose and frequency.

9.2 Field personnel may assist patients with the administration of physician prescribed devices, including but not limited to, patient operated medication pumps, sublingual nitroglycerin, and self-administered emergency medications, including epinephrine devices
