4.1 Adult trauma patients are defined as being 15 years of age or older

4.2 Pediatric trauma patients are defined as being 14 years of age or younger

5. Exceptions: The patient is identified as meeting Red or Yellow trauma criteria, but presents with one of the following:

| PATIENT PRESENTATION | ACTION |

6. PATIENT TURNOVER REPORTING FORMAT: EMS Clinicians should use the following DMIST format when turning over patient care to the Trauma Center medical team:
Î Demographics
Î Mechanism
Î Injuries
Î Signs - Vital signs
Î Treatments

7. BASE HOSPITAL CONTACT: Varying field circumstances make rigid application of any set of rules impractical. These criteria should serve as guidelines. Clinical circumstances may dictate that transport be undertaken immediately with Base Hospital contact made during transport

7.1 Contact the Base Hospital Physician if:
► The patient meets the criteria listed in the "Yellow Criteria" but the provider is requesting transport to a basic ED
► The patient requires medical treatment not covered in the Trauma Patient Care protocol
► The patient would benefit from consultation with the Base Hospital Physician

8. OUT-OF-COUNTY TRANSPORT

8.1 Patients who meet Trauma Patient Criteria may be transported directly to an out of county Trauma Center if it is the closest, most appropriate destination for the patient

8.2 Prior to transporting to an out-of-county Trauma Center, the transporting provider must:
► Contact the out-of-county Trauma Center by land line to determine if they can accept the patient
► Give a brief report including E.T.A. (See Reporting Format Protocol)
► Contact the Alameda County Base Hospital if medical consultation is required (see #5 above)
