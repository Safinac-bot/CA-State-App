NEONATAL RESUSCITATION

Patient Care Policy (Pediatric)
Modified On: June 29, 2023

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•Resuscitation should be initiated on all premature infants who meet the following criteria:
Weight: > 500 gms or 1 pound and Gestational Age: ≥ 20-24 weeks
•If naloxone considered for persistent respiratory depression, HR and color must first be restored
•Avoid naloxone for neonates whose mothers are suspected of long-term exposure to opioids
•Use an LBRT to determine pediatric medication dosages - (Shown underlined on the algorithm)
•Note: Manage the patient's airway with proper airway positioning, simple airway adjuncts, suctioning, and BVM ventilation as necessary. Consider Advanced Airway Management (page 112) if BVM ventilation is not adequate.

NOTE: Routine suctioning of vigorous, full term newborns at birth is not indicated. Wiping the face, nose, mouth is preferred

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Term Gestation?
Amniotic fluid clear?
Breathing or crying?
Good muscle tone?

YES → Provide warmth
      Position - Clear airway if needed
      Dry, stimulate, reposition
      
      Breathing & HR > 100?
      
      YES → Pink?
            
            YES → Post Resuscitation care
                  Monitor
            
            NO (Cyanotic?) → Provide warmth
                             Clear airway if needed
                             Dry off
                             Assess color
                             
                             Supplemental O2
                             
                             Persistent Cyanosis?
                             
                             YES → Effective ventilation, HR > 100 & color pink
                             
                             NO → Post Resuscitation care
                                  Monitor
      
      NO (Apneic or HR < 100) → Positive pressure ventilation
                                 40-60 breaths/minute
                                 
                                 HR < 60?
                                 
                                 YES → Continue ventilation
                                       Administer chest compressions
                                       compression:ventilation ratio 3:1
                                       (90:30 for a total of 120 combined events/minute)

                                       See LBRT for dose - may repeat LBRT dose x 1 as needed
                                       
                                       HR < 60?
                                       
                                       YES → Continue resuscitation
