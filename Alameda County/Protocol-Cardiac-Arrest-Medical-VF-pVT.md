CARDIAC ARREST - MEDICAL - VF/PVT
Patient Care Policy (Adult)
Modified On: January 1, 2025

•Routine Medical Care
•Note: Use of a mechanical CPR device is required whenever available and appropriate

VF/Pulseless VT notes:
*Chest compressions:
CPR/mCPR must be minimally interrupted (<10 secs) and should not be paused for airway placement. mCPR does not need to be paused for defibrillation(s). Manual chest compressors must be rotated at every rhythm check.

**Defibrillation:
Refer to manufacturer's documentation for energy dose recommendations

***Epinephrine
May be repeated q 5mins to a max of 3 doses

Apply mechanical CPR (mCPR) device if available
