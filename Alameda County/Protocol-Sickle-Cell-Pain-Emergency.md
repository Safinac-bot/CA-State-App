SICKLE CELL PAIN EMERGENCY

•Early and aggressive pain management is key to stopping the progression of ischemic processes associated with Sickle Cell emergencies.
•Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are at higher risk for other serious conditions including ACS, CVA, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for other serious etiologies to symptoms especially in the setting of patient reporting abnormal pain or S/S patterns.

Special Considerations:
► Absence of tachycardia/hypertension does not rule out sickle cell emergencies. Prompt and aggressive analgesia is always recommended for patients reporting pain
► Triggers for sickle cell emergencies can be infection, temperature changes, dehydration, stress/lack of sleep
► Priapism can be a presentation of sickle cell emergencies and should be treated with aggressive pain control
► Pregnancy is not a contraindication to opioid use in patients with sickle cell pain emergencies

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Pt c/o pain and/or S/S consistent with prior SCD episode per pt.

YES → Pain Management

      BLS Interventions
      (Do not delay ALS interventions while waiting for BLS interventions to improve patient pain)
      → Heat packs/blankets/warming measures
      → Distraction (Screen/phone use)
      
      ALS Interventions
      Fentanyl
      IV: 1 mcg/kg (50-100 mcg) Slow push. Repeat q 5min PRN to a max. cumulative dosage of 200 mcg
      IM/IN: 1 mcg/kg (50-100 mcg) Repeat q 10min PRN to a max. cumulative dosage of 200 mcg
      
      OR
      
      Ketamine
      IV: 0.3 mg/kg in 100ml of NS/D5W Slow IV Infusion over 10 minutes. (max. dose is 30 mg, no repeat)
      IM/IN 0.3 mg/kg (max. dose is 30 mg, no repeat)
      
      Additional Interventions/Adjuncts PRN:
      → IV fluids only if hypovolemic/dehydrated
      → Oxygen if SpO2 is ≤ 95%
      → Ondansetron PRN for N/V
      → Diphenhydramine for allergic reaction S/S
      → Consider Ketorolac if the above interventions are contraindicated, declined, or ineffective (see pain management protocol)
      
      Transport per Transport Guidelines Protocol

NO → Assess for other serious conditions such as ACS, CVA, pulmonary embolus and utilize appropriate protocol(s) for patient presentation
