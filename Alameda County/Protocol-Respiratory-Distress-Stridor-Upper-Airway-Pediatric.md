Patient Care Policy (Pediatric)
Modified On: May 10, 2019

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•CROUP/EPIGLOTTITIS:
ÎIf the patient deteriorates, or becomes completely obstructed, positive pressure ventilation via bag-valve-mask should be attempted
ÎDo not attempt to visualize the throat or insert anything into the mouth if epiglottitis suspected
ÎAllow a parent to hold the child or the O2 mask if the presence of the parent calms the child
ÎMinimize outside stimulation. Keep the patient calm
ÎPosition of comfort
•Use an LBRT to determine pediatric medication dosages - (Shown underlined on the algorithm)
•Note: Manage the patient's airway with proper airway positioning, simple airway adjuncts, suctioning, and BVM ventilation as necessary. Consider Advanced Airway Management (page 112) if BVM ventilation is not adequate.
