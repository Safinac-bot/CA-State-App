CARDIAC ARREST - GENERAL GUIDELINES

Assess cause of arrest (medical vs. trauma)

MEDICAL → Proceed to appropriate Cardiac Arrest- Medical protocol

TRAUMA → Proceed to Cardiac Arrest- Trauma protocol

For Cardiac Arrests of all causes:
 ☐ Initiate and maintain manual chest compressions until a mCPR device is available and appropriate to place
 ☐ Minimize interruptions to chest compressions at all times
 ☐ Immediately initiate timekeeping
 ☐ Consider SGA placement if persistent hypoxia/hypercarbia is present with BLS airway (OPA with BVM)
 ☐ Do not interrupt chest compressions for airway management

Patient Disposition

Go to appropriate cardiac arrest protocol for guidance on patient dispositions

Special Considerations:
● BLS and ALS prehospital personnel are not required to initiate resuscitative measures in circumstances of obvious death, signed DNR/POLST form, or upon meeting Family Discretion Criteria as outlined in Determination of Death in the Field protocol.
● Consider strangulation/hanging as causes of arrest and treat as a Medical Cardiac Arrest with SMR if suspected spinal cord injury.
