SEPSIS

Sepsis is the body's overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection. In Sepsis, when an infection occurs at any potential site in the body, the immune system's inflammatory response can be overwhelmed leading to SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) which causes tissue damage that can lead to organ dysfunction, failure and death. The symptoms of SIRS can include fever, tachypnea, tachycardia or hypotension.

1. Risk Factors
► Age (Elderly, Newborn)
► Diabetes
► Compromised immune system including:
  • Cancer
  • Renal Disease
  • Alcoholism / IV Drug Abuse
  • Malnutrition
  • Hypothermia
  • Recent surgery or invasive procedure

2. Although sepsis patients can be any age, the Prehospital Sepsis Screening Tool triages for sepsis patients aged 15 years and older. For these patients, notify the receiving hospital of a SEPSIS ALERT as early as possible via radio or phone.

*Consider: Sepsis Alert patients present with various signs and symptoms. Additionally, patients with ≥ 2 SIRS criteria, an EtCO2 of ≤ 25 mmHg are strongly correlated with lactate levels > 4 mM/L and increased mortality

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Does patient have suspected or documented infection?

YES → Does patient meet TWO or more of the following SIRS criteria?
      - Temp > 100.4 or < 96
      - HR > 90
      - RR > 20
      
      YES → Monitor EtCO2*
            ↓
            Call a SEPSIS ALERT to the receiving hospital
            ↓
            Initiate Fluids IV/IO
            ↓
            If patient also has signs and symptoms of shock, administer IV/IO NS in 500-1000ml boluses. Reassess. Titrate fluid boluses to SBP > 90 or to 30 ml/kg total fluid dose
            ↓
            If patient continues to have signs and symptoms of shock after 30ml/kg total fluid dose, consider Epinephrine diluted to 0.01mg/ml (10mcg/ml), 0.5ml (5mcg) slow IV/IO, titrate to SBP > 90
            
            Push Dose Epinephrine mixing instructions:
            » Take Epinephrine 1 mg of 0.1 mg/ml preparation (Cardiac Epinephrine) and waste 9 ml of Epinephrine
            » In that syringe, draw 9 ml of normal saline from the patient's IV bag and shake well
            » Mixture now provides 10 ml of Epinephrine at a 0.01mg/ml (10 mcg/ml) concentration
      
      NO → Observe and monitor

NO → Observe and monitor
