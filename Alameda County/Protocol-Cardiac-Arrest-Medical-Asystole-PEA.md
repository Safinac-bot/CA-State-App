Patient Care Policy (Adult)
Modified On: January 1, 2025

•Routine Medical Care
•Consider and treat other possible causes – See CPR page 10
•If patient presents with signs of obvious death or a valid DNR is presented - See Determination of Death in the Field Procedure

CPR
ECG / AED
BLS Airway (OPA)
BVM ventilation with 10-15 lpm O2
ETCO2 Monitoring
↓
IV / IO NS
↓
Epinephrine 0.1mg/mL
1 mg IV/IO
q 5 minutes, up to 3 doses
(1st dose ASAP – preferably within 5 min from start of CPR)
↓
Consider Advanced Airway
↓
2 minutes or 5 cycles of CPR
Check rhythm
↓
Shockable rhythm?

YES → Proceed to Cardiac Arrest – Medical – VF/pVT protocol

NO → Organized rhythm and pulse present?
      
      YES → Proceed to:
            Return of Spontaneous Circulation protocol or
            Bradycardia protocol or
            Tachycardia protocol
      
      NO → Consider:
            Determination of Death Criteria – Medical Arrest Resuscitation or
            Continue CPR Transport

Important Considerations:
■ Do not interrupt CPR to administer medications or perform airway management
■ Use of a mechanical CPR device is required whenever it is available and appropriate
■ Consider and treat reversible causes as appropriate:
  • Hypovolemia • Hypoxia • Hydrogen ion (acidosis) • Hypo-/hyperkalemia • Hypothermia
  • Tension pneumothorax • Tamponade, cardiac • Toxins • Thrombosis, pulmonary / coronary
■ If renal failure or hyperkalemia suspected, you may consider administering the following:
  Calcium Chloride 1 gm slow IVP (over 2 min.)
  Note: flush IV tubing after administering CaCl to avoid precipitation
  Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IVP
  Note: make sure to have a second IV line as other medications may not be compatible
