RESPIRATORY DISTRESS

•Routine Medical Care
  Î Asthma
  Î COPD
  Î Bronchospasm
  Î Pulmonary edema (see page 45)
•Limit physical exertion, reduce patient anxiety

NOTE: For patients with COPD, oxygen supplementation should be given to achieve an oxygen saturation of 88%-92%. Higher oxygen saturations in COPD patients have been shown to be harmful.
