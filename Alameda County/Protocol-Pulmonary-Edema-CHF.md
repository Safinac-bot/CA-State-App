PULMONARY EDEMA / CHF

•Routine Medical Care
•Consider ASA, 162 – 324 mg po, for acute coronary syndrome patients
•Perform 12-Lead ECG, and transport to a STEMI Receiving Center if STEMI is identified. (See page 120 - ECG 12-Lead) for STEMI Receiving Center information
•Rapid transport if on scene stabilization is unlikely

*Note #1:
Consult the base physician if the B/P drops below 90/systolic at any point, before continuing NTG, or for any questions regarding dosage

^ Note #2:
✓ Repeat vital signs between doses.
✓ Only increase NTG dose to 0.8 mg while the B/P is > 150/systolic.
✓ If B/P drops below 150/systolic resume 0.4 mg dose.
