CARDIAC ARREST - TRAUMATIC

Patient Care Policy (Pediatric)
Modified On: January 1, 2025

•Do not resuscitate in the setting of obvious death as outlined in Determination of Death in the Field protocol, mass casualty incidents, or if staging, extrication (without resuscitation) and/or transport exceeds 20 minutes.

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Initiate CPR
BLS Airway (OPA and BVM)
Control major bleeding (tourniquet/wound packing)
SMR as indicated by MOI (see note #4)
Initiate Transport to Trauma Center (see note #6)

During transport:
→ Initiate ECG, SpO2 and ETCO2 monitoring
→ Consider SGA placement if persistent hypoxia/hypercarbia with BLS airway
→ Bilateral needle thoracostomy if tension pneumothorax is suspected (see Pleural Decompression procedure)
→ IV access x 2 (large bore) – IO access if unable to obtain IV access
→ IV/IO bolus of 1 liter NS

Shockable rhythm identified?

YES → Defibrillate and proceed to
      Cardiac Arrest – Medical – VF/pVT protocol

NO ↓

Continuously reassess airway and need for suction, hemorrhage control (efficacy of tourniquet, place pelvic binder for suspected pelvic fracture)

Continue to destination and transfer patient care

Special Considerations:

1. Prioritize rapid transport

2. Consider strangulation/hanging as causes of arrest and treat as a Medical Cardiac Arrest with SMR if suspected spinal cord injury and proceed to appropriate medical cardiac arrest protocol

3. ALS procedures in the field do not significantly improve outcomes for traumatic arrest patients

4. Provide spinal motion restriction if indicated by mechanism or signs of blunt head/neck trauma. A backboard may be helpful to support chest compressions and transport

5. Epinephrine administration:
-Do not administer if arrest was caused by hypovolemia from exsanguination
-Do administer for arrests caused by hanging, strangulation, submersion/drowning, or blunt cardiac trauma (commotio cordis – likely minimal signs of external chest trauma but VF/VT rhythm)

6. Destination choice:

Patient to Trauma Center:
-Penetrating or Blunt trauma with significant hypovolemia from exsanguination
-Submersion or Mechanical Asphyxiation (drowning, hanging, strangulation) with suspected head or spinal injury

Patient to closest hospital:
-Submersion or Mechanical Asphyxiation (drowning, hanging, strangulation) without suspected head or spinal injury

7. Trauma is not a contraindication for the use of mechanical CPR device as long as it does not delay transport
