TXA - TRANEXAMiC ACiD

1. DESCRIPTION - Tranexamic Acid (TXA) is a Lysine analogue that works to inhibit the formation of plasmin, which is a molecule responsible for clot degradation. It has had multiple medical applications in the past including pre-operative use, menorrhagia, hemophilia and hereditary angioedema. It has recently been shown in multiple studies to reduce mortality in trauma patients meeting specific physiologic criteria or who have obvious signs of massive hemorrhage.

2. INCLUSION CRITERIA

Within three hours of onset of injury or illness, prehospital administration of TXA should be considered for all patients with blunt or penetrating trauma or other massive uncontrolled bleeding (Vaginal hemorrhage, etc.) that have signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic shock and meet any one of the following inclusion criteria:

► SBP < 90 mmHg
► Significant hemorrhage with a HR > 120
► Bleeding not controlled by direct pressure or tourniquet
► Major amputation of any extremity above the wrists or ankles

EXCLUSION CRITERIA

► Any patient <15 years of age
► Any patient more than three hours post-injury
► Isolated penetrating cranial injury
► Traumatic brain injury with brain matter exposed
► Suspected cervical cord injury with motor deficits

3. ADMINISTRATION

3.1 Administer TXA 1 gram in 100ml NS or D5W IV/IO over 10 minutes

Do NOT administer IV push. This will cause hypotension.

3.2 Place an approved wristband on the patient.

3.3 Ensure that RN/MD at receiving facility is notified that TXA was administered.

3.4 Follow IV fluid resuscitation guidelines on page 25, "Trauma Patient Care"
