TRAUMA PATIENT CARE
Patient Care Policy (General)

•Routine Medical Care
•Critical Interventions - See below
•Transport Decision - Determine need for rapid intervention/transport
•Transport
•If traumatic arrest is suspected do not use ACLS medications

CRITICAL/TIME SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS:

► Control major external hemorrhage (see page 122)
► Control the Airway - Consider endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway device if indicated (See below for patients with closed head trauma)
► Keep patient warm
► Determine patient severity (see "Trauma Patient Criteria" - see page 26):

Meets Physiologic and/or Anatomic Factors:
Î Transport to the Trauma Center In accordance with Transport Guidelines (page 22).
Î ADULT - Establish one (1) large bore IV/IO with Normal Saline (NS) or Saline Lock (SL). Establish 2nd IV if appropriate.
Î PEDIATRIC- Establish one (1) appropriate large bore IV/IO with Normal Saline (NS) or Saline Lock (SL).
Do NOT delay transport to establish IV/IO access

Meets Mechanism of Injury Criteria:
Î Transport to the Trauma Center code 2.
Î ADULT/PEDIATRIC - Establish one (1) large bore IV/IO with Normal Saline (NS) or Saline Lock (SL).

See "Trauma Patient Criteria" (page 26) for additional judgment decisions on code 2 transports

► Consider spinal motion restriction (SMR) for blunt trauma (see page 134)
► Administer Oxygen - Titrate SpO2 to 94-99%
► IV fluid resuscitation:
  Î SBP < 90 mmHg, NS IV/IO 250 – 500ml bolus
  Î > 90 mmHg, IV/IO TKO or Saline Lock
  Î Reassess BP q 5 minutes
► Consider TXA for patients with signs of shock or uncontrolled bleeding (see page 140)
► Care of the patient with a closed head injury (GCS < 8):
  Î Advanced airway (ETT or SGA)
  Î End-tidal CO2 should be between 30-35 mmHg
  Î Track respirations or ventilate to a rate of approx 12 times/minute with 100% O2 (AVOID HYPERVENTILATION)
  Î IV/IO NS in 500 mL increments to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 80 mmHg. Reassess BP q 5 minutes

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
► Contact the Base Hospital, if appropriate
► Contact the Trauma Center, as soon as possible
► Consider pain management when appropriate
► Splint fractures and dress wounds ONLY if time permits

FORMULA FOR ESTIMATING MAP
MAP = diastolic + (systolic - diastolic) / 3
