ADVANCED AiRWAY MANAGEMENT

Procedures
Modified On: May 10, 2019

1. INTRODUCTION: The approved airway management procedure consists of endotracheal intubation (ETI) or insertion of a supraglottic airway (SGA) device.

***Nasotracheal intubation is NOT an approved skill in Alameda County***

1.1 Manage the patient's airway with proper airway positioning, simple airway adjuncts, suctioning, and BVM ventilation as necessary with all patients.

1.2 For patients ≥ 40kg, personnel are authorized to perform the skill of endotracheal intubation or placement of an SGA.

1.3 For patients < 40kg, BVM ventilation is the preferred method of ventilatory management. If BVM ventilation is unsuccessful or impossible, a SGA device may be placed.

1.4 If advanced airway placement will interrupt chest compressions, providers may consider deferring insertion of the airway until the patient fails to responds to initial CPR and defibrillation or demonstrates ROSC (2015 AHA Guidelines)

1.5 Personnel must confirm tube placement (ETI or SGA) with capnography / capnometry, auscultation and physical assessment (auscultation, observation of chest rise, visualization of the tube passing through the cords, etc.). See Section #4.

2. INDICATIONS:

2.1 Non-traumatic cardiac and/or respiratory arrest.

2.2 Traumatic cardiac and/or respiratory arrest or severe ventilatory compromise where the airway cannot be adequately maintained by BLS techniques.

3. APPROVED ADVANCED AIRWAY MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE:

3.1 Endotracheal intubation

3.1.1 Definition: An intubation attempt is defined as the insertion of the laryngoscope blade into the patient's mouth.

3.1.2 All ETI attempts should be performed with two providers.

3.1.3 All ETI attempts must utilize a gum elastic bougie device when direct laryngoscopy (DL) or non-channeled video laryngoscopy (VL) is utilized. Channeled VL does not require bougie utilization.

3.1.4 The maximum ETT size that can be utilized for ETI is 7.0mm.

3.1.5 Make no more than 2 total intubation attempts per patient. Each attempt should not last longer than 30 seconds. Ventilate with 100% oxygen for one minute prior to each attempt.

3.1.6 If patient has a Cormack-Lehane* grade of 3 or 4 (epiglottis is not or is barely visible), consider primary use of a supraglottic airway.

3.2 Supraglottic Airway Device (i-gel®)

3.2.1 Definition: A supraglottic airway attempt is defined as the insertion of the supraglottic airway device into the patient's mouth.

3.2.2 For patients ≥ 40kg, a supraglottic airway (i-gel®) device may be placed as a primary airway (if Cormack-Lehane grade is 3 or 4) or after unsuccessful attempt(s) at endotracheal intubation.

3.2.3 For patients < 40kg, BVM ventilation is the preferred method of ventilatory management. If BVM ventilation is unsuccessful or impossible, an SGA device may be placed

3.2.4 The i-gel® SGA device comes in seven sizes determined by the patient's weight:

| Size | 1.0 | 1.5 | 2.0 | 2.5 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|
| Weight (kg) | 2-5kg | 5-12kg | 10-25kg | 25-35kg | 30-60kg | 50-90kg | >90kg |

3.2.5 The patient should be in the sniffing position. The chin should be gently pressed down/inferior before proceeding to insert the i-gel device.

3.2.6 Introduce the leading soft tip into the mouth of the patient in a direction toward the hard palate.

3.2.7 Glide the i-gel device downwards and backwards along the hard palate with a continuous, but gentle push until definitive resistance is felt.

3.2.8 Do not apply excessive force during insertion.

3.2.9 If unexpected resistance is met during insertion, apply jaw-thrust and slightly rotate the device.

4. CONFIRM TUBE PLACEMENT: To be used on an endotracheal tube or the i-gel® device in the order listed below

4.1 Visualize the ETT passing through the vocal cords and look for chest rise with ventilation.

4.2 Auscultate both lung fields for breath sounds. Listen over left upper quadrant of the abdomen for air in the stomach

4.3 Waveform capnography/capnometry must be continuously monitored.

4.4 Document. All devices used to confirm ETT/SGA placement should be electronically uploaded into and documented on the patient's EHR.

4.4.1 Describe waveform (e.g. box, shark fin, straight line, bumpy line, etc.)

4.4.2 Capnometry number in mmHg (e.g.15 mmHg) should be, at a minimum, documented at the initiation of monitoring, after every patient movement, and at transfer of patient care.

4.5 If there is any doubt as to proper placement of the endotracheal tube, visualize the pharynx and vocal cords with laryngoscope and use capnographic waveform to make a decision. If still in doubt, suction the patient, deflate the cuff, remove the endotracheal tube and replace with a supraglottic airway. (Be prepared - removal of an ET tube may induce vomiting). Ventilate between attempts with 100% oxygen

5. If the patient regains consciousness while intubated, do not extubate. Use restraints as necessary to prevent uncontrolled extubation. Consider Sedation (see Sedation page 131)

6. If the patient has a suspected spinal injury:

► Open the airway using a jaw-thrust without head extension
► If airway cannot be maintained with jaw thrust use a head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver
► Manually stabilize the head & neck rather than using an immobilization device during CPR
