VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES -VAD

Patient Care Policy (Adult)
Modified On: May 10, 2019

OVERVIEW:

1. The VAD assists the native ventricle pumping action and provides the cardiac output needed to survive.

2. These devices are either pulsatile or continuous flow (non-pulsatile/pulseless). They are further divided into:
ÎLeft Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD), The more common continuous flow pump located in the patient's thorax attached to the patients' left ventricle and aorta
ÎRight Ventricular Assist Devices (RVAD),
ÎBiventricular Assist Devices (BiVAD).

ASSESSMENT:

3. Assess for presence of a DNR, POLST or Advance Directive.

4. First ASSESS THE PATIENT, not the device.
ÎThe reason for the call may or may not be a problem with the VAD. VAD patients can and frequently do have other medical conditions.
ÎPatients with a continuous flow VAD may have no discernible pulse or blood pressure.
► Because there may be no palpable pulse, utilize other parameters for patient assessment (level of consciousness, skin signs, capillary refill, etc.)
► Pulse oximetry may be unreliable.
ÎUtilize the American Heart Association's C-A-B recommendations, with one addition:
► C = Circulation / Connections and Function (device)
► A = Airway
► B = Breathing
ÎETCO2 will read accurately and be useful in assessment.

5. Assess the device to see if it is working.
ÎInformation regarding the type of device, the implantation hospital, and/or the VAD Coordinator contact telephone number may be available by a tag on the device, on the refrigerator, or on a medical alert bracelet.
ÎIf a caregiver is present, utilize his/her knowledge. The patient and their caregiver are the experts on scene for all issues related to the VAD. Listen to their directions regarding VAD device management until you are able to contact the VAD Coordinator.
ÎThe VAD Coordinator can help you decide the best course of action regarding assessment of the equipment. NOTE: Only the base hospital is legally allowed to give orders regarding patient care.
ÎIf the patient has a continuous flow VAD (non-pulsatile / pulseless), auscultate the left upper quadrant of the patient's abdomen for the "hum" of the VAD, which can help direct the appropriate actions.
► A pulsatile VAD will make an audible sound without auscultation.
► Pulsatile VADs are usually older devices which pump blood via pulsatile mechanism, generating a peripheral pulse.
ÎDetermine if the device has power.
► If the device has power it does not necessarily mean that it is working, so the previous step is very important.
► If the device has power, you will see a green light on the HeartMate II, the most commonly implanted device
► On the HeartWare device, the display will clearly tell you the Liters per Minute (LPM) of blood flow.
ÎCheck the VAD for secure connections and that the batteries are charged and functional.

6. Remain patient-centric. Check the VAD device as directed, but remain aware of how your patient is doing clinically. Deliver routine medical care as required.
ÎIf the pump is pumping then the problem is usually with the patient, not the device.
ÎDo ABCs in conjunction with your VAD assessment.

TREATMENT/TRANSPORT:

7. If the patient's condition is related to their VAD, and it is safe and reasonable, it is preferred to transport the patient to their Bay Area VAD centers (Kaiser Santa Clara, Stanford, UCSF, and CPMC) unless the patient has any of the following conditions:

7.1 MINOR medical or trauma patients with adequate perfusion: Follow appropriate protocol and transport to ANY basic ED or hospital of record.

7.2 Suspected STROKE (STROKE ALERT) patient: Follow Acute Stroke policy and transport to closest Stroke Center.

7.3 Suspected STEMI (STEMI ALERT) patient: Follow CP Suspect Cardiac/STEMI policy and transport to closest STEMI Center.

7.4 Trauma patient (activation): Follow Trauma Care Policy and transport to closest Adult Trauma Center.

7.5 Cardiac Arrest or critical / unstable patients (poor perfusion): Follow Shock or appropriate resuscitation policy and transport to closest STEMI / Cardiac Arrest Center.

7.6 "Ring down" the receiving hospital early to help the facility prepare for this highly specialized patient.
