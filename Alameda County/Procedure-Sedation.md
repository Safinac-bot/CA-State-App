SEDATiON

1. GENERAL INDICATIONS:

1.1 To reduce combative behavior that endangers patient or caregivers

1.2 As an adjunct to pain relief for ALS procedures such as cardioversion and/or cardiac pacing

1.3 Use CAUTION with:

► Concomitant use of an opiate and midazolam can cause significant respiratory depression, hypotension and decreased level of consciousness. Administer concomitantly only when absolutely indicated. Administer lower doses of one or both agents

► Elderly patients are especially sensitive to the effects of midazolam. They should receive a lower dose and especially close monitoring

► A very small proportion of patients may have a paradoxical effect (i.e. - increased agitation)

2. CONTRAINDICATIONS:

2.1 Absolute:
► Sensitivity to Midazolam
► Systolic BP < 90 mmHg (adult) - except for patients who need TCP or cardioversion

2.2 Relative:
► Nausea/vomiting
► Depressed mentation
► Suspected drug/alcohol intoxication
► Multiple systems trauma
► Head injury
► Concomitant narcotic administration - (this is a RELATIVE contraindication and is not intended to prevent the use of necessary narcotic analgesia, when indicated)

(These MAY be the most likely cause for the condition that requires proposed sedation. The best judgment of the paramedic is necessary to evaluate the need for sedation)

3. PROCEDURE:

3.1 Give supplemental oxygen (titrate to 94-99% SpO2)

3.2 Institute continuous cardiac monitoring

3.3 Continuously monitor the patient using the Airway Checklist, including ETCO2

3.4 Establish IV access if possible

3.5 Be prepared to provide airway/ventilation management

3.6 Ensure that receiving hospital personnel are aware that patient has been sedated

SEDATION INDICATIONS AND MEDICATION DOSING:

INDICATIONS:
☐ To reduce combative behavior that endangers patient or caregivers
☐ Anticipated:
  • Cardioversion in the conscious patient
  • Cardiac pacing in the conscious patient

MEDICATION – DOSE/ROUTE:

MIDAZOLAM:

Adult:
☐ IV/IO (slowly): 1-2 mg increments- titrated to desired degree of sedation. May repeat, q 5 min, to a total max dose of 10 mg
