HEMORRHAGE CONTROl

Procedures
Modified On: May 6, 2013

1. INTRODUCTION: Controlling severe bleeding from an extremity injury can be challenging (especially in the lower limbs). Use of a County-approved tourniquet can assist in the care of patients with uncontrollable bleeding in the extremities safely and effectively when the appropriate precautions are taken. Approved for both ALS and BLS.

2. INDICATIONS:
► Amputation
► Failure to stop bleeding with pressure dressing(s)
► Injury does not allow control of bleeding with pressure dressing(s)
► Impaled foreign body with ongoing extremity bleeding
► Under difficult or dangerous situation for responding caregivers
► Mass casualty event
► Significant extremity hemorrhage in the face of any or all of:
  • Need for airway management
  • Need for breathing support
  • Circulatory shock
  • Need for other emergent interventions or assessment
  • Significant bleeding from multiple locations

3. TOURNIQUET: Place County-approved tourniquet according to manufacturer's instructions

4. WOUND PACKING: Significant uncontrolled bleeding from extremity and junctional (shoulder or groin) wounds may be packed with standard or hemostatic gauze. Wounds to the chest, abdomen, or pelvis should not be packed.

5. HEMOSTATIC AGENT: After tourniquet placement, and to aid in severe arterial bleeding; or to control severe bleeding where tourniquets are not indicated (trunk, head, neck, etc), use of a hemostatic gauze is indicated. Use of hemostatic gauze is optional.

6. PROCEDURE: Any standard gauze or County-approved hemostatic gauze may be utilized

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Significant Extremity Bleeding with need for other interventions?*

* Before applying a tourniquet, and if time permits, attempt to control bleeding via direct pressure

NO → Go to appropriate protocol

YES ↓

Apply tourniquet to bleeding limb(s) on proximal segment

Transport time > 30 minutes expected?

NO → Leave on and transport

YES ↓

Go to tourniquet reassessment algorithm

TOURNIQUET REASSESSMENT ALGORITHM:

Patient in circulatory shock?

YES → Leave on and transport

NO ↓

Unstable clinical situation?

YES → Leave on and transport

NO ↓

Limited personnel or resources?

YES → Leave on and transport

NO ↓

Go to tourniquet removal algorithm

§ NOTE: Do not go to the Tourniquet Removal Algorithm unless transport time is greater than 30 minutes AND criteria have been met in the Tourniquet Reassessment Algorithm for removal

TOURNIQUET REMOVAL ALGORITHM§:

Amputated extremity?

YES → Leave on and transport

NO ↓

Significant Bleeding from site?

YES → Leave on and transport

NO → Reassess as needed
