INTERFACILITY TRANSFERS

Modified On: July 24, 2018

Note: This policy pertains to emergency transfers to a higher level of care that come through the 9-1-1 system. See "Scheduled Interfacility Transfers Using Paramedic Personnel" (policy #4605 Administration Policy Manual) for more information.

1. All patient care rendered by prehospital care personnel must be within the defined scope of practice according to Title 22 and Alameda County EMS protocols

2. A paramedic may only take orders from a base hospital physician. (See 5.2 below) There are no provisions for an EMT to take orders from a physician

3. EMT-Bs may only transfer a patient without an emergency medical condition; or, with an emergency medical condition that has been stabilized and has no potential (within reasonable probability) to deteriorate en route

4. Paramedics (in addition to 3) may only transport a patient who has not been stabilized to a facility that provides a higher level of care. The transferring physician must determine if the care that may be required during transport is within the scope of practice of a paramedic. If not, appropriate hospital staff and/or equipment should be sent with the patient

5. Base Contact by Paramedics

5.1 Base Contact is required prior to transport if the transferring physician orders any ALS treatment and/or the patient has not been stabilized

5.2 Paramedics may follow transferring physician's written orders ONLY when 1) the transferring physician speaks to the Base Physician, and they mutually agree on the course of treatment; 2) the proposed treatment plan is within the paramedic's scope of practice

5.3 Base Physician contact shall be made:
â–º When there is a request to transfer a patient to a higher level of care facility that is not the "closest, most appropriate" higher level of care facility.

5.4 Base Contact is not required if the patient is stable and no ALS treatment has been ordered by the transferring physician. If the patient's condition changes during transport see the appropriate patient care policy and treat accordingly

6. Base Contact may be made anytime a paramedic has a question regarding patient condition, destination and/or the appropriateness of the transfer

7. An Alameda County Unusual Occurrence (U.O.) form should be completed for any problem-oriented interfacility transfers. The U.O. form should be sent to the EMS office for review. [See Administration Manual UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES (#2300)]

8. Refer to "Interfacility Transfer Guidelines" [see Administration Manual INTERFACILITY TRANSFER GUIDELINES (# 5600)] for transfer approval process
