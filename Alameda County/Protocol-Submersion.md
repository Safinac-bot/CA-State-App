SUBMERSION

•Routine Medical Care
•Consider spinal precautions prior to extrication if possibility of neck trauma
•Rapid extrication from water
•If hypothermia suspected and the patient is in Ventricular Fibrillation, rapid transport to the closest receiving hospital is essential for rewarming. Patients who are hypothermic rarely respond to treatment. (see Hypothermia page 17)
•Consider CPAP - see CPAP procedure (page 118) for indications
