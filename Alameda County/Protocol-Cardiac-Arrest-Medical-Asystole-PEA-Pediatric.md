CARDIAC ARREST - MEDICAL - ASYSTOLE/PEA

Patient Care Policy (Pediatric)
Modified On: January 1, 2025

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•In PEA, identify other causes and treat (See CPR page 10)
•Use an LBRT to determine pediatric medication dosages - (Shown underlined on the algorithm)
•Note: Manage the patient's airway with proper airway positioning, simple airway adjuncts, suctioning, and BVM ventilation as necessary. Consider Advanced Airway Management (page 112) if BVM ventilation is not adequate.

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Immediate and uninterrupted chest compressions
Place ECG / AED
 ☐ BLS Airway (OPA)
 ☐ BVM ventilation with 10-15 lpm O2
 ☐ ETCO2 Monitoring

Shockable rhythm?

YES → Proceed to:
      Cardiac Arrest – Medical – VF/pVT protocol

NO ↓

2 minutes CPR
30:2 5 cycles 1 rescuer
15:2 10 cycles 2 rescuers
Check rhythm

Shockable rhythm?

YES → Proceed to:
      Cardiac Arrest – Medical – VF/pVT protocol

NO ↓

Resume CPR
IV / IO NS

Epinephrine 0.1mg/mL IV/IO
See LBRT for dose
(1st dose ASAP – preferably within 5 min from start of CPR)
q 5 minutes, up to 3 doses

Do not interrupt CPR to administer medications

Non-shockable rhythm continues?

YES → Consider Determination of Death Criteria – Medical Arrest Resuscitation

NO ↓

Continue CPR and medication administration
Transport

If pulse present - post resuscitation care
Proceed to Bradycardia protocol or Tachycardia protocol
