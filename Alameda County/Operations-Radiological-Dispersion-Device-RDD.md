1. Background:

1.1 Principal type of "dirty bomb" combines a conventional explosive such as Dynamite/Explosives with radioactive material

1.2 A conventional explosive itself would have more immediate lethality than dirty bombs

1.3 Most probably, not enough radiation would be present in a dirty bomb to:
► Kill people
► Cause severe illness

1.4 Most radioactive material employed in hospitals is sufficiently benign

1.5 About 100,000 patients a day are released with this material in their bodies

1.6 Certain other radioactive materials could contaminate up to several city blocks

1.7 It could create fear and possibly panic and requiring potentially costly cleanup

1.8 A second type of RDD might involve a powerful radioactive source hidden in a public place

1.9 Hiding places may include such places as :
► Trash receptacles
► Latrines
► Delivery vehicles
► Vending machines
► Parked vehicles

1.10 A dirty bomb is in no way similar to a nuclear weapon

1.11 The presumed purpose of its use would be as a Weapon of Mass Disruption

1.12 Not as a Weapon of Mass Destruction

2. Impact of a Dirty Bomb:

2.1 The extent of local contamination would depend on a number of factors

2.2 Factors includes:
► The size of the explosive
► The amount and type of radioactive material used
► The weather conditions

2.3 Prompt detection of the kind of radioactive material employed would greatly assist local authorities

2.4 It would assist in advising the community on protective measures, such as:
► Quickly leaving the immediate area or
► Going inside until being further advised

2.5 Subsequent decontamination of the affected area could involve considerable:
► Time
► Expense

3. What Should You Do Following an Explosion

3.1 Move away from the immediate area--at least several blocks from the explosion

3.2 Head inside and establish shelter-in-place

3.3 This to reduce exposure to radioactive dust

3.4 Turn to radio/TV channels for advisories from:
► Emergency response
► Health authorities

3.5 If facilities are available, remove clothes and place them in a sealed plastic bag

3.6 Save contaminated clothing to allow for testing for radiation exposure

3.7 Take a shower to wash off dust and dirt, or to reduce radiation exposure, if the explosive device is radioactive

3.8 If radiation was released, local news will advise people where to report for:
► Radiation monitoring
► Blood tests
► Other tests

3.9 Test to determine if in fact exposed and what steps to take to protect health.

4. Risk of Cancer

4.1 Short time or small doses of radioactive dust does not mean a person will get cancer

4.2 The additional risk will likely be very small

4.3 Potassium Iodide (KI) will not be protective except in the unlikely event that the dirty bomb contained radioactive iodine isotopes

4.4 The iodine isotopes would have to be in large quantities

4.5 Radioactive iodine isotopes are not particularly attractive for use in an RDD

4.6 KI only protects the thyroid from radioactive iodine

4.7 KI offers no protection to other parts of the body or against other radioactive isotopes
