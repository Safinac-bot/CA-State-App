ALTERED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS

•Routine Medical Care
•Obtain a complete patient history including current medications
•Identify and document neurological deficits
•Naloxone should not be given as treatment for altered level of consciousness in the absence of respiratory depression (respiratory depression = rate of less than 8 breaths per minute) (see page 46)
•Note: Glucose paste may be administered if the patient: 1) is able to hold head upright; 2) has a gag reflex; and, 3) can self-administer the medication
•Dextrose should not be given with suspected Acute Stroke unless blood sugar reading is < 60 mg/dL
•Perform 12-Lead ECG, as appropriate, and transport to a STEMI Receiving Center if STEMI is identified. (See page 120 - ECG 12-Lead) for STEMI Receiving Center information
•SMR for trauma or suspicion of trauma (see page 134)
•Contact the Base Physician if:
  Î the Blood Glucose reading is > 60 mg/dL but hypoglycemia is suspected

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Result < 60 mg/dL?

YES → Dextrose 10%
      First dose

      ↓
      Recheck blood glucose 5-10 minutes after D10 administration. If the patient's blood glucose remains < 60 mg/dl
      ↓
      Give additional Dextrose 10%
