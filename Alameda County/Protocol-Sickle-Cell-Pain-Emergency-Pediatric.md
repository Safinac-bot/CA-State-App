SICKLE CELL PAIN EMERGENCY

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•Early and aggressive pain management is key to stopping the progression of ischemic processes associated with Sickle Cell emergencies
•Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are at higher risk for other serious conditions including ACS, CVA, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for other serious etiologies to symptoms especially in the setting of patient reporting abnormal pain or S/S patterns

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Pt c/o pain and/or S/S consistent with prior SCD episodes per pt. or guardian

YES → *Pediatrics with SCD are at risk of CVA
      
      Assess for other serious conditions such as ACS, CVA*, and pulmonary embolus and utilize appropriate protocol(s) for patient presentation
      
      Pain Management
      
      BLS Interventions
      (Do not delay ALS interventions while waiting for BLS interventions to improve patient pain)
      → Heat packs/blankets/warming measures
      → Distraction (Screen/phone use)
      
      ALS Interventions
      Fentanyl IN (preferred)/IM/IV - May repeat dose on LBRT q 5 min, to a max. of 3 total doses via all routes
      Non-opioid medications (Ketorolac, Tylenol)
      See LBRT for dosing
      
      Additional Interventions/Adjuncts PRN:
      → IV fluids only if hypovolemic/dehydrated
      → Oxygen if SpO2 is ≤ 95%
      → Diphenhydramine for allergic reaction S/S
      → Ondansetron PRN for N/V
      
      Transport per Transport Guidelines Protocol

NO → (Continue with appropriate assessment and protocol)

Special Considerations:
 ☐ Absence of tachycardia/hypertension does not rule out sickle cell emergencies. Prompt and aggressive analgesia is always recommended for patients reporting pain
 ☐ Triggers for sickle cell emergencies can be infection, temperature changes, dehydration, stress/lack of sleep
 ☐ Priapism can be a presentation of sickle cell emergencies and should be treated with aggressive pain control
 ☐ Pregnancy is not a contraindication to opioid use in patients with sickle cell pain emergencies
