SUBMERSION

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•Contact the Base Physician if patient is also showing signs of pulmonary edema before moving to the appropriate policy
•Consider CPAP (see CPAP page 118 for indications)
•Consider spinal precautions prior to extrication if possibility of neck trauma. Otherwise place the patient on his/her side to protect the airway and prevent aspiration; be prepared to suction
•Rapid extrication from water
•Initiate rapid transport to the closest most appropriate receiving hospital
•Note: If hypothermia is suspected and the patient is in ventricular fibrillation, rewarming is essential. Remove wet clothing, wrap in warm blankets and place in warm ambulance
