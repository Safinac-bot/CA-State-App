ROUTINE MEDICAL CARE - PEDIATRIC

The defined age of a pediatric patient is 14 years old or less, and unless specified otherwise, pediatric protocols should be used to treat these patients. Note: An infant is considered to be < 1 year old. A child is considered to be ≥ 1 year old. Specified ages for transport or treatment other than 14 years old include:

TRANSPORT

5150 Psych Evaluation (page 128):
ÎChildren ( ≤ 11 y.o.) – Children's Hospital
ÎAdolescents ( ≥ 12 y.o. & ≤ 17 y.o.) – ALCO Youth CSU

Trauma Destination (page 26):
Î≤ 14 y.o. – Children's Hospital
Î≥ 15 y.o. – Closest Adult Trauma Center

Sexual Assault (page 3):
ÎChildren ( ≤ 13 y.o.) – Children's Hospital
ÎAll Others ( ≥ 14 y.o.) – Highland or Washington

TREATMENT

Advanced Airway Management (page 112):
Î<40kg- authorized airway is OPA/NPA, BVM, or SGA

CPAP (page 118):
Î< 8 y.o. – Absolute Contraindication

IO Access (page 125):

Refusal of Care (page 114):
Î≤ 17 y.o. may not refuse transport or treatment unless legally emancipated

An approved Alameda County-specific, pediatric LBRT shall be used to determine appropriate medication dosages, fluid volumes, defibrillation settings and equipment sizes. The tape is designed to estimate a child's weight based on length (head to heel). When the child's height exceeds the length of the tape, refer to the adult dose.

PRIMARY SURVEY SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Establish level of responsiveness
► AVPU: Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive

Evaluate airway and protective airway reflexes
► Identify signs of airway obstruction and respiratory distress, including:
Îcyanosis
Îstridor
Îdrooling
Îtachypnea
Î intercostal retractions
Î absent breath sounds
Î apnea or bradypnea
Î choking
Î grunting
Î nasal flaring

Secure airway
► Open airway using jaw-thrust and chin-lift (and/or head tilt if no suspected spinal trauma). Suction as needed. Consider placement of an oral or nasal airway adjunct if the child is unconscious
► If cervical spine trauma is suspected, see page 134

Consider Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR)

Assess need for ventilatory assistance
► Use chest rise as an indicator of ventilation
► Use pulse oximetry

Evaluate and support circulation. Stop Hemorrhage
► CPR as needed (see CPR page 10)
► Assess perfusion using the following indicators:
Îheart rate
Î mental status
Î skin signs
Îquality of pulse
Î capillary refill
Î blood pressure

Continue with secondary survey
► Perform a head-to-toe assessment, including temperature
► Obtain a patient history
► Do environmental assessment, consider possibility of intentional injury

Determine appropriate treatment protocols
► Provide family psychosocial support
► An approved Alameda County-specific, pediatric LBRT shall be used to determine appropriate medication dosages, fluid volumes, defibrillation settings and equipment sizes.
► When starting an IV/IO/saline lock, use chlorhexidine as a skin prep
► Label insertion site with "PREHOSPITAL IV – DATE and TIME"
► Pediatric patients are subject to rapid changes in body temperature. Steps should be taken to prevent loss of or increase in body temperature
► Compared to the adult patient, a small amount of fluid, lost from or administered to, a pediatric patient can result in shock or pulmonary edema
► Scene time for treatment of pediatric patients should be kept at a minimum. Most treatment should be done en route
