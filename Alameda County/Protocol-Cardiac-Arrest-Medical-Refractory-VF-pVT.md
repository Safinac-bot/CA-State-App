CARDIAC ARREST - MEDICAL - REFRACTORY VF/PVT
Patient Care Policy (Adult)
Modified On: January 1, 2025

•Routine Medical Care
•Note: Use of a mechanical CPR device is required whenever available and appropriate
•Indications: VF/Pulseless VT is considered refractory if 3 defibrillations have been delivered and additional defibrillation(s) are required at any point in a resuscitation.

VF/Pulseless VT notes:
*Chest compressions:
CPR/mCPR must be minimally interrupted (<10 secs) and should not be paused for airway placement. mCPR does not need to be paused for defibrillation(s). Manual chest compressors must be rotated at every rhythm check.

**Defibrillation:
Refer to manufacturer's documentation for energy dose recommendations

***Epinephrine
May be repeated q 5mins to a max of 3 doses

If patient meets the above indications, prepare a second defibrillator and place the second defibrillator's pads in the anterior/lateral position as pictured

Double-sequential defibrillation steps:
1. Charge both defibrillators to recommended energy level
2. Deliver shock using defibrillator placed in A/P position first
3. Deliver shock with A/L placed defibrillator 1 second after the first defibrillation
DO NOT DELIVER SHOCKS SIMULTANEOUSLY

Shockable rhythm?

NO → Go to Policy: Asystole/PEA page 37 or Return of Spontaneous Circulation page 48

YES →
CPR while defibrillators are charging
Double-sequential Defibrillation (see note)
Resume CPR
Prepare for patient transport to STEMI Center
Notify receiving STEMI center of pt inbound with refractory VF/VT as early as possible
