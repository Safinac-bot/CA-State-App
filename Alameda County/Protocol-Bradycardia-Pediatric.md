BRADYCARDIA

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•Consider and treat other possible causes:
ÎHypoxia (most common)
ÎHypothermia
ÎHead Injury
ÎHeart Block
ÎToxins/ drugs
ÎBeta Blockers or calcium channel blockers
•Use an LBRT to determine pediatric medication dosages - (Shown underlined on the algorithm)
•Note: TCP reserved for children with symptomatic bradycardia refractory to BLS and ALS interventions. Use pediatric electrodes if child weighs < 15 kg

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Maintain patent airway, assist breathing as needed
02 – titrate to 94-99% SpO2
Monitor

HR = <60?

NO → Signs/symptoms of symptomatic bradycardia?
     
     NO → Consider obtaining 12-lead ECG
          Ongoing assessment and transport
     
     YES → Ensure that airway and breathing are being effectively managed
           Obtain IV/IO access
           
           Epinephrine 0.1mg/mL IV/IO
           See LBRT for dose
           Repeat Epinephrine q 3-5 min
           
           If increased vagal tone or primary AV block:
           Atropine 0.1mg/mL IV/IO
           See LBRT for dose
           May repeat q 3-5 minutes

YES → Start CPR
      Maintain continuous CPR until patient condition improves or interventions below are effective
      
      Signs/symptoms of symptomatic bradycardia?
      
      YES → Ensure that airway and breathing are being effectively managed
            Obtain IV/IO access
            
            Epinephrine 0.1mg/mL IV/IO
            See LBRT for dose
            Repeat Epinephrine q 3-5 min
            
            If increased vagal tone or primary AV block:
            Atropine 0.1mg/mL IV/IO
            See LBRT for dose
            May repeat q 3-5 minutes
            
            Consider TCP
            Continue CPR during TCP until electrical and mechanical capture is obtained
            Consider Sedation procedure and Pain Management protocol
            
            If asystole/PEA develops, proceed to:
            Cardiac Arrest – Medical – Asystole/PEA
      
      NO → Consider obtaining 12-lead ECG
           Ongoing assessment and transport

Signs/Symptoms of Symptomatic bradycardia:
 ☐ Acute ALOC
 ☐ Weak pulses
 ☐ Hypotension
 ☐ Central Cyanosis

Abbreviated TCP Steps
1. Apply pacer pads in A/P configuration
2. Set pacer rate to 100 bpm
3. Increase pacer current to secure electrical capture
4. Check for mechanical capture by palpation of femoral pulse
5. Increase pacer current by 5-10mA

See TCP Procedure for additional information

Example of ECG with electrical capture
