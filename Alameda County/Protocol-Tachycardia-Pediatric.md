TACHYCARDIA

Modified On: June 29, 2023

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•Use an LBRT to determine pediatric medication dosages - (Shown underlined on the algorithm)

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Support ABCs if needed
O2 – titrate to 94‐99% SpO2
Attach monitor

Evaluate QRS duration

Narrow QRS < 0.08sec | Wide QRS >0.08 sec

NARROW QRS:

Evaluate rhythm
Consider causes: compensatory vs. non‐compensatory

Sinus Tachycardia
< 220/min ‐ infant
< 180/min ‐ child
P waves ‐ present/normal
R to R ‐ variable
PR ‐ constant

→ Treat underlying cause(s)
   Consider: Fluid bolus – See LBRT for dose
   May repeat LBRT dose x 1

Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)
> 220/min ‐ infant
> 180/min ‐ child
P waves ‐ absent/abnormal
Heart rate ‐ constant

If stable (with pulses and good perfusion)
→ Consider: Vagal Maneuver
   
   Adenosine Rapid IVP
   See LBRT initial dose (max. 1st dose 6 mg)
   See LBRT repeat dose (max. 2nd dose 12 mg)

If unstable (with pulses but poor perfusion)
→ Synchronized Cardioversion
   See LBRT for dose
   If not effective, increase to the next dose listed on LBRT
   
   Consider Sedation but do not delay cardioversion
   See Sedation page 138

WIDE QRS:

Possible/probable V‐tach

If stable (with pulses and good perfusion)
→ Consult with Base Physician for
   Amiodarone IV/IO infusion (over 20‐60 mins)
   See LBRT for dose

If unstable (with pulse but poor perfusion)
→ Synchronized Cardioversion
   See LBRT for dose
   If not effective, increase to the next dose listed on LBRT
   
   Consider Sedation but do not delay cardioversion
   See Sedation page 138
