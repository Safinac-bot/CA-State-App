AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION

•Routine Medical Care
•If obstruction due to laryngeal trauma, see page 25 "Trauma Patient Care"
•Obstruction due to epiglottitis:
  Î Do not attempt to visualize the throat or insert anything into the mouth
  Î Minimize outside stimulation. Keep the patient calm. Position of comfort.
•Do not use a tongue/jaw lift or perform blind finger sweeps
•Rapid Transport

*Signs of severe obstruction:
✓ Poor air exchange
✓ Increased breathing difficulty
✓ Silent cough
✓ Cyanosis
✓ Inability to speak or breathe
✓ Ask the patient "Are you choking"? If patient nods yes, act

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

*Severe signs of obstruction?

YES → Apply abdominal thrusts in rapid sequence. If ineffective, or the patient is obese or in the late stages of pregnancy, consider chest thrusts.
      ↓
      Continue abdominal and chest thrusts.
      ↓
      If the patient becomes unresponsive:
      Begin CPR
      Check mouth for F.B.
      ↓
      If the patient deteriorates, or becomes completely obstructed, positive pressure ventilation via bag-valve-mask should be attempted first.
      ↓
      Able to ventilate adequately?
      
      YES → Maintain airway and Oxygen
            ↓
            Transport to the closest ED
      
      NO → If airway can not be maintained with BVM
           Consider: Intubation (see page 108)
           ↓
           Attempt Intubation
           or
           Assist Ventilation with Bag-Valve-Mask

NO → Suspect epiglottitis?
     
     YES → Maintain airway and Oxygen
           Position of comfort
     
     NO → Maintain airway and Oxygen
          Position of comfort
