Patient Care Policy (General)
Modified On: July 1, 2014

•Routine Medical Care
•Rescuer safety
•Assume airway/respiratory involvement
•Stop the burning process - DO NOT USE COLD PACKS 
•Assess for associated trauma

A. BASIC ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

1. Assess Airway and Breathing
1.1 Assess for thermal airway injury and smoke inhalation - quick list of S/S here
1.2 High flow oxygen is critical - ??? for all burns
1.3 Be prepared for intubation

2. Assess and expose
2.1 Perform a mini neurological exam - level of consciousness
2.2 Expose and examine the patient for other areas of burn
2.3 Remove jewelry, but do not remove stuck clothing

3. Obtain vascular access
3.1 Obtain at least one IV access point for pain management and fluid resuscitation and if possible a second IV for major burns

4. Administer IV fluids – See

5. Document burn severity and treat the pain
5.1 Estimate the severity of the burns using the ABA Classification or the "Rule of 9s or "Rule of 1s""
5.2 Treat pain. Pain management should be considered mandatory for moderate to severe burns. See Pain Management Policies – Adult (page 43) and Pediatric (page 74)

6. Protect against hypothermia and infection - dress burns
6.1 Dry, sterile dressing for any burn involving >10% TBSA (Total Body Surface Area)
6.2 Keep patient warm to prevent hypothermia (use sheets or blankets)
6.3 Moist, sterile dressings are OK for small burns (<10% TBSA)

7. Elevate burned body parts - 30°

8. Address psychological needs
8.1 Be honest and compassionate
8.2 Consider anxiolytics – Contact Base Physician for Midazolam

9. Maintain body temperature and observe for hypothermia

B. ELECTRICAL BURNS

1. Turn off the power source if patient is still attached
2. See first responder defibrillation protocol if patient is unconscious and pulseless

C. TAR BURNS

1. Do not attempt to remove the tar
2. Cool with water
3. Maintain body temperature and observe for hypothermia

D. CHEMICAL BURNS

1. Remove clothing

2. Liquid chemicals:
Î Flush immediately with copious amounts of tepid water for 10 - 15 minutes

3. Dry chemicals:
Î Brush off as much as possible, then flush with copious amount of tepid water for 10 - 15 minutes

4. Identify chemical

5. Assess for associated respiratory burns
