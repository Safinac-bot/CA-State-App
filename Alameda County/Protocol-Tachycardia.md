TACHYCARDIA

•Routine Medical Care
•Serious Signs and Symptoms:
ÎChest Pain Î Acute MI
ÎShock Î CHF
Î BP < 90/systolic Î Decreased LOC
Î Shortness of Breath Î Pulmonary Congestion
•Synchronized Cardioversion:
•Stop if rhythm converts to Sinus Rhythm
•Immediate cardioversion is seldom needed for heart rate < 150 beats/min
•Precardioversion sedation in the awake patient whenever possible, however, use with caution in the hypotensive patient. See Sedation page 131

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Is patient stable?

NO → **If patient is unstable, do not delay cardioversion to start an IV
     ↓
     ✓IV/ IO NS
     ✓Consider: precardioversion sedation with Midazolam
     ✓ Consider Pain Management titrate to effect (see page 42)
     ✓ Immediate Synchronized Cardioversion
     100 J, 200 J, 300 J, 360 J monophasic energy dose (or clinically equivalent biphasic energy dose ++)
     
     If any delay in synchronized cardioversion, and the patient is critical, go to defibrillation.
     
     ++Both monphasic and biphasic waveforms are acceptable
     
     Rhythm converts?
     
     YES → Monitor
     
     NO → Base Physician consult

YES → IV/ IO NS
      12-lead EKG or rhythm strip
      O2 – titrate to 94-99% SpO2
      Monitor
      ↓
      Narrow QRS or Wide QRS > 0.12 sec?
      
      NARROW QRS:
      
      Regular rhythm?
      
      YES → ✓ Vagal maneuver
            ✓ If no conversion: ^Adenosine
            ✓ If patient becomes unstable go to appropriate arm of this algorithm
            
            Monitor for recurrence. Treat with ^Adenosine
      
      NO → Look for and treat underlying cause
      
      WIDE QRS:
      
      Regular rhythm?
      
      YES → If V-tach or uncertain:
            Amiodarone Drip:
            150 mg in 100 ml D5W give over 10 mins. (= 100 gtts/min with 10 gtts/ml tubing)
      
      NO → Look for and treat underlying cause

^Adenosine dose:
✓6 mg rapid IV
If no response in 2 minutes:
✓12 mg rapid IV
