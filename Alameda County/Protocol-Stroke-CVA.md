STROKE / CVA
Modified On: January 1, 2025

•Routine Medical Care
•Rapidly identify signs of a stroke using the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) and Posterior Stroke Scale (PSS)
•For detailed information on obtaining a CPSS / PSS - See the Procedures Section - Stroke Assessment Scales
•Last Known Well Time (LKWT) must be obtained from a reliable patient or bystander. See note
•Limit on scene time to <15 minutes and initiate rapid transport for 'Stroke Alerts' to a designated Stroke Receiving Center

Special Considerations:
► The LKWT information must be provided by a reliable party or reported by a reliable patient. If the reliable party cannot accompany the patient to the receiving facility, a phone number for that party must be obtained
► The patient may be transported to their designated Stroke Receiving Center of choice, as long as this does not add more than 10 minutes to the transport time
► Determine if the patient has recently taken blood thinner medications and report this finding to the receiving facility
► For patients whose onset of S/S is between 6-24 hrs, consider not utilizing red lights and siren during transport
