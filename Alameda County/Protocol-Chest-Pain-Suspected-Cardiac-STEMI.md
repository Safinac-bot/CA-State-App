CHEST PAIN - SUSPECTED CARDIAC/STEMI

•Routine Medical Care
•Signs of Shock - 2 or more of the following:
  Î Pulse > 120/minute
  Î Pale, cool and/or diaphoretic skin signs
  Î BP < 90/systolic
  Î Altered Mental Status
•If cardiac chest pain is suspected and the patient is able to swallow, give Aspirin 162 - 324 mg po as soon as possible (tablet or chewable – not enteric coated)
•NTG may be prioritized as needed based on patient presentation
•Perform 12-Lead ECG, as appropriate, and transport to a STEMI Receiving Center if STEMI is identified. See page 120 - ECG 12-Lead for ECG transmission and STEMI Receiving Center information
•Note: If the patient has taken erectile dysfunction (ED) medication within the last 24 hours (Viagra/Levitra) or 36 hours (Cialis), withhold nitroglycerin
•Patients who have oxygen saturations of greater than 94% without signs or symptoms of hypoxia or impending airway compromise should not receive oxygen.

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Monitor
Assess ABC's
O2 – titrate to 94-99%
Aspirin 162-324 mg
IV/IO NS
↓
*12-lead EKG
Do not delay transport if technical difficulties impede EKG transmission. Attempt to send en-route whenever possible.
↓
STEMI?

YES → Transmit EKG to STEMI Receiving Center (SRC) (see page 118)
      Transport to SRC
      Establish 2nd IV en-route

NO → NTG 0.4mg
     up to 3 doses, q 3-5 minutes for continuing pain/discomfort
     ↓
     If unresponsive to nitrates:
     Pain Management (see page 42)
     (^^see note)
     
     Note: If B/P drops below 90 systolic or drops > 30 mm/Hg from baseline at any point; or, heart rate is < 50 or > 120 bpm, contact the base physician before administering/continuing NTG and/or Pain Management

If cardiogenic shock, tachycardia, or life threatening dysrhythmia go to appropriate policy
