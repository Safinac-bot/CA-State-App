ACTIVE SHOOTER RESPONSE

1.1 ACTIVE SHOOTER RESPONSE- The EMS response to Active Shooter Incidents needs to be coordinated with on scene law enforcement.

1.2 EMS providers need to be ready to enter a secured scene quickly and aggressively

1.3 EMS providers should be "forward leaning" and have trauma focused medical gear and triage tools available

1.4 Working closely with law enforcement is critical in getting life saving medical assets to the injured as soon as the threat has been mitigated or neutralized. The UNIFIED COMMAND model is best for these types of incidents

1.5 Make sure law enforcement command knows that an EMS team is ready, staged and awaiting direction. Most SWAT teams have an imbedded tactical medic that would be the logical liaison to EMS assets on scene

1.6 Concepts applied are based on the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) and the International School of Tactical Medicine (ISTM)

2. Consider the following items during an EMS response to an Active Shooter Incident:

► Communication must be maintained throughout the incident with respective dispatch centers and on scene medical, fire and law enforcement

► Law enforcement is in charge of the event. While in a warm zone environment, EMS should follow the direction of law enforcement

► Law enforcement may provide a protective envelope (force protection model) around EMS providers and escort them into "warm zone" areas to treat or evacuate victims. (No active threat in the area)

► Make sure to have emergency egress routes and casualty collection points (CCP), as well as evacuation rally points identified

► If EMS team is brought in to extricate patient, only minimal equipment should be carried. Roll up evacuation stretchers should be considered

► EMS teams need to be prepared to split up if law enforcement requires it

► EMS providers should use individual medical packs with life saving bleeding and airway tools so they can work "independently" on trauma victims

► Spinal motion restriction is not indicated for patients suffering only from penetrating trauma

► Once the threat is eliminated, law enforcement may be available to help evacuate the injured
