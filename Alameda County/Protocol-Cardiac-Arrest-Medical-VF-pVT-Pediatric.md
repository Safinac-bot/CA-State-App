CARDIAC ARREST - MEDICAL - VF/PVT

Patient Care Policy (Pediatric)
Modified On: January 1, 2025

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•Use an LBRT to determine pediatric medication dosages - (Shown underlined on the algorithm)
•Note: Manage the patient's airway with proper airway positioning, simple airway adjuncts, suctioning, and BVM ventilation as necessary. Consider Advanced Airway Management (page 112) if BVM ventilation is not adequate

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Immediate and uninterrupted chest compressions
Place ECG / AED

Do not delay defibrillation for completion of these interventions.
 ☐ BLS Airway (OPA)
 ☐ BVM ventilation with 10-15 lpm O2
 ☐ ETCO2 Monitoring
