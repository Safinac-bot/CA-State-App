TRANSFER OF CARE

AUTHORITY: Division 2.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, Section 1798.6

"Authority for patient health care management in an emergency shall be vested in that licensed or certified health care professional, which may include any paramedic or other prehospital emergency personnel at the scene of the emergency, who is most medically qualified specific to the provision of rendering emergency medical care. If no licensed or certified health care professional is available, the authority shall be vested in the most appropriate medically qualified representative of public safety agencies who may have responded to the scene of an emergency."

"Notwithstanding ... authority for the management of the scene of an emergency shall be vested in the appropriate public safety agency having primary investigative authority. The scene of an emergency shall be managed in a manner designed to minimize the risk of death or health impairment to the patient and to other persons who may be exposed to the risks as a result of the emergency condition, and priority shall be placed upon the interests of those persons exposed to the more serious and immediate risks to life and health. Public safety officials shall consult emergency medical services personnel or other authoritative health care professionals at the scene in the determination of relevant risks."

1. Medical personnel will not enter an unsafe emergency/crime scene, or continue to render care until released by the incident commander. Public safety personnel shall secure the scene to make entry reasonably safe

2. Components of the transfer of care at the scene of an emergency include:

2.1 Evaluation of the scene

2.2 Medical aspects of extrication and all movement of the patient(s)

2.3 Assessment

2.4 Treatment rendered

2.5 Destination

3. If a disagreement occurs between medical personnel at the scene on any aspects of the transfer of care:

3.1 If time permits, contact the Base Physician to determine the appropriate treatment/destination. Otherwise, the more conservative patient-based decision will prevail (e.g. if field personnel disagree on transport vs. non-transport, the patient will be transported)

3.2 If necessary, involved personnel will immediately notify the EMS on-call representative through ALCO-CMED. The EMS on-call representative will notify the EMS Medical Director

3.3 If appropriate, the EMS Medical Director will organize a meeting with the involved personnel to resolve the issues within two (2) business days
