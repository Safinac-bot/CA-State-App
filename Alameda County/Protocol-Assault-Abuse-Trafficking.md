2. SEXUAL ASSAULT: This involves any form of non-consensual conduct/contact with another person, or the inability of the victim to give consent due to age, cognitive disability, or voluntary/involuntary incapacitation by substances. Substances are involved in the majority of sexual assaults, keep a high index of suspicion on these patients. When EMS responds to a victim of sexual assault:

2.1 Use best judgement when assigning the primary-care provider noting the gender could be triggering to the victim

2.2 Explain in advance each treatment/procedure and offer the patient simple choices (e.g. to sit up or recline on the gurney) empowering them to feel in control.

2.3 Mirror the patient's language (e.g., do not say "rape" or "sexual assault" if the patient has not used those words)

    •Routine Medical Care
    •Level of distress - Is patient a trauma victim? If yes, see trauma protocol 
    •Provide emotional support to the victim and the family
    •Contact appropriate law enforcement agencies

2.4 Keep the assessment brief and injury-focused: 
► Do not interview the patient about the assault
► In the absence of hemorrhage, there is rarely a need to visualize genitalia
► Assess the patient for strangulation injuries, as this is common with sexual assault

2.5 Preserve the physical evidence:
► Transport the patient "as found." Discourage showering, removing/changing clothes, brushing teeth, using mouthwash, smoking, eating or drinking. Do not allow the patient to wash or clean their hands.
► If clothes have been removed, place clothing in a paper bag. Do not use plastic bags; they collect moisture, which degrades important organic material. If it is necessary to cut off the patient's clothes, cut around soiled, torn, or damaged areas by 6 inches.
► Do not clean, irrigate, or apply ointment to wounds. If necessary, apply dry sterile gauze to wounds.
► If the patient needs to urinate, or vomit, preserve in a clean container (e.g. urinal, emesis basin). This evidence especially important with drug-facilitated sexual assaults.
► Chain of custody must be maintained for each item to be valuable in the forensic process. This is best accomplished by having the patient keep all evidence collected at scene in their possession or law enforcement maintaining possession.

2.6 Transport the patient to a facility capable of performing the sexual assault forensic exam regardless of the hospital's diversion status. This exam can be performed up to 21 days post assault.
► Adult patients: Wilma Chan Highland Hospital or Washington Hospital
► Pediatric patients: Children's Hospital (≤13 y.o.)

3. SUSPECTED HUMAN TRAFFICKING: Human trafficking involves labor or services, by means of force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of subjection into commercial sex acts or other involuntary servitude. If the person is under 18 years of age, no force, fraud or coercion is required.

3.1 Warning signs of human trafficking include:
► Manifest signs of physical neglect – malnourished, unreasonable workplace injuries
► Individuals, who are isolated/segregated from contact with responders, are physically or emotionally bullied by others, or who don't have control of their own ID/documents.
► Live or work in locations with unsuitable living conditions or unreasonable safety working environments.
► Incidents where responders are approached and asked for protection/asylum from other individuals at a scene

3.2 Reporting requirements:
► EMS personnel should send an Unusual Occurrence report to Alameda County EMS at alco.uo@acgov.org for any suspected human trafficking cases. The information provided will be relayed directly to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center for Human Trafficking.
► For suspected human trafficking offer the patient the 24/7 Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline number 888-373-7888 if doing so does not compromise patient safety.

4. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and (DV) LETHALITY SCREEN

4.1 DEFINITION: Domestic violence is the willful intimidation, physical assault, battery, sexual assault, and/or other abusive behavior as part of a systematic pattern of power and control perpetrated by one intimate partner against another.

4.1.1 Notify Law Enforcement and Receiving Facility staff (as needed)

4.1.2 Perform Domestic Violence Lethality Screen in Section 4.2

4.2 Determine level of distress – is patient injured or complaining of any medical complaints?

► Assess and treat as appropriate
► Attempt private audience with patient (maintaining regard for safety)
► If patient c/o or presents with medical complaints, assess for signs & symptoms of possible strangulation
► If patient is NOT transported - and if safe, appropriate and feasible - perform a DV Lethality Screen (see questions below in Section 4.3)
► If patient is transported, be sure to inform receiving facility of lethality risk (determined by tool) and DV advocacy steps taken

Î If patient screens HIGH RISK, refer patient to the Family Violence Law Center (FVLC) by calling the FVLC 24/7 hotline # 800-947-8301
Î Briefly describe the DV circumstances to the FVLC advocate without providing any patient identifying information
Î If patient consents to speaking with FVLC advocate, hand patient the phone
Î If patient does not consent to speaking with FVLC advocate, give patient discreet FVLC resource information and advise that he/she can call 24/7
Î Repeat basic safety planning tips that the FVLC advocate provides

4.3 Questions used in the Domestic Violence Lethality Screen for First Responders

ÎA "yes" response to any of Questions 1–3 automatically triggers the protocol referral

1. Has he/she ever used a weapon against you or threatened you with a weapon?
2. Has he/she threatened to kill you or your children?
3. Do you think he/she might try to kill you?

ÎNegative responses to Questions 1–3, but positive responses to at least four of Questions 4–11, trigger the protocol referral

4. Does he/she have a gun or can he/she get one easily?
5. Has he/she ever tried to choke you?
6. Is he/she violently or constantly jealous or does he/she control most of your daily activities?
7. Have you left him/her or separated after living together or being married?
8. Is he/she unemployed?
9. Has he/she tried to kill himself?
10. Do you have a child that he/she knows is not his/hers?
11. Does he/she follow or spy on you or leave threatening messages?

If patient consents, any first responder may trigger the protocol referral to FVLC if not already triggered above, as a result of the victim's response to the question below, or whenever the first responder believes the victim is in a potentially lethal situation

Î Is there anything else that worries you about your safety? (If "yes") What worries you?
