ANAPHYLAXIS / ALLERGIC REACTION

•Epinephrine IM is the cornerstone of treatment of anaphylaxis and should be given as early as possible. It is best absorbed from an injection in the lateral thigh
•If the patient is in severe distress, administer Epinephrine IM and consider immediate transport
•SIGNS OF ANAPHYLAXIS (Systemic Reaction) – wheezing, repetitive cough, tightness in chest, stridor, difficulty swallowing or tightness in throat, change in voice, dizziness or feeling faint, abdominal complaints (pain, repeated vomiting, diarrhea or incontinence), anxiety, lethargy
•SIGNS OF ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK – pallor, hypotension, cool, clammy mottled skin, altered sensorium
•FACIAL/ORAL SWELLING (Angioedema) can accompany anaphylaxis, but is not always present
•Use a length-based resuscitation tape (LBRT) to determine pediatric medication dosages and fluid bolus

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

ANAPHYLAXIS (Systemic Reaction)
↓
EPINEPHRINE 1mg/ml IM
BLS Providers: 0.15mg IM
ALS Providers: See LRBT for IM dose-
may repeat LBRT dose x 1 in 5 min

OXYGEN
If Any Distress

** SIGNS OF SHOCK?

YES → IV/IO Access
      FLUID BOLUS NS
      See LRBT for dose - may repeat x 1
      
      Assist ventilations with BVM as required
      
      Reassess 5-10 mins. after IM Epi. If V/S not improved with fluid bolus:
      EPINEPHRINE 0.1mg/mL IV/IO slow push***
      See LBRT for IV/IO dose
      •Max single dose 0.1 mg
      •May repeat q 5 minutes
      
      If no response Base Physician consult

NO → For persistent wheezing or respiratory distress
     ALBUTEROL
     5 mg in 6 ml NS via hand-held nebulizer, mask, or BVM
     
     Consider for Urticaria (Hives/ Itching)
     § DIPHENHYDRAMINE
     See LBRT for IV/IM/IO dose
     Max. dose: 50mg

*ALLERGIC REACTION (Skin or mucous membrane symptoms only without signs of anaphylaxis or airway obstruction)

Consider for Urticaria (Hives/ Itching)
§ DIPHENHYDRAMINE
See LBRT for IV/IM/IO dose
Max. dose: 50mg

NOTES

* If patient develops signs of anaphylaxis, go to other arm of this algorithm

**Shock in children may be subtle and hard to recognize. BP readings may be difficult to determine or inaccurate and may be a late sign of shock.

***IV/IO epinephrine should only be used if symptoms are unresponsive to IM epinephrine and patient has signs of profound shock

§ Diphenhydramine may lessen discomfort from rash/itching but is not an essential treatment of anaphylaxis. Consider reduced dosage if patient has taken diphenhydramine in the past 1-2 hrs.
