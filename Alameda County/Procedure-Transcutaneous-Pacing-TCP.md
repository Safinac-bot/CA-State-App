TRANSCUTANEOUS PACiNG - TCP

1. INDICATIONS: This procedure should be used on patients experiencing symptomatic bradycardia (see Adult Bradycardia or Pediatric Bradycardia protocols. This includes patients with "failed" pacemakers. Note: Bradycardia in children is usually due to respiratory causes

Consider alternate causes of the dysrhythmia and treat appropriately prior to initiation of TCP:
► Hypoxia
► Trauma
► Drug overdose
► Electrolyte imbalance (not treatable in the field setting)
► Hypothermia

2. CONTRAINDICATIONS:

2.1 Asystole

2.2 Bradyasystolic arrest

2.3 Hypothermia

3. PROCEDURE:

3.1 Consider sedation with midazolam (See Sedation procedure) and/or appropriate Pain Management protocol for all conscious patients undergoing pacing. Hypotension is not an absolute contraindication in this setting. If unable to start IV, consider administering IM or IN

3.2 Place pads on the patient in anterior/posterior (A/P) position. If unable to place posterior pad, the pads can be placed in the anterior/lateral (A/L) position. Do not place pads over pre-existing implanted devices such as pacemakers or AICDs

3.3 Set pacing rate to:

3.3.1 Adults (≥15 y/o): 60-80 bpm (goal of >30 bpm above patient's initial rate)

3.3.2 Pediatrics (≤14 y/o) set pacing rate at 100 bpm

3.4 Start pacer current output at 0 milliamps (mA). Increase milliamps until electrical captured is obtained on the ECG (Max 120mA)

3.5 Confirm mechanical pacer capture by palpation of a femoral pulse. A pulse should be associated with at least every paced QRS complex. (Note: assessment of carotid pulse is not recommended as pacing can cause muscle contractions that are difficult to distinguish from pulse)

3.6 If electrical/mechanical capture cannot be achieved at 120mA, change vector of pads and repeat above steps.

3.7 Pediatric patients: Continue CPR until able to achieve electrical/mechanical capture

3.8 Once both electrical and mechanical capture obtained, increase the pacer current by 5-10mA

3.9 Once electrical and mechanical capture is obtained, the pacing rate may be increased slowly to relieve patient's symptoms (acute ALOC, hypotension, weak pulses, or central cyanosis) from bradycardia

4. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

4.1 TCP should not be delayed for IV access, 12-lead ECG, or while waiting for atropine to take effect in an unstable patient

4.2 CPR is safe during TCP and should be performed in pediatric population

4.3 Electrical capture can occur without mechanical capture. Electrical capture can be assessed on the monitor with identification of QRS complexes after every pacer spike. Mechanical capture is evaluated with palpation of a femoral pulse with every QRS complex

4.4 TCP is safe to perform in pregnant patients
