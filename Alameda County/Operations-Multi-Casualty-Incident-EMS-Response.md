MUlTI-CASUAlTY INCIDENT - EMS RESPONSE

MCI/ Disaster/ WMD
Modified On: May 29, 2019

1. INTRODUCTION: A Multi-Casualty Incident (MCI) is any incident where the number of injured persons exceeds the day-to-day operating capabilities; requiring additional resources and/or the distribution of patients to multiple hospitals. This may be different for each incident based on time of day, location, resources available, etc.

2. NOTIFICATIONS: Incident Commanders shall make notifications through ACRECC. Organizations should have internal notification procedures

3. MCI RESOURCE ORDERING, INITIATION AND TERMINATION:

3.1 The first arriving unit should initiate an MCI through ACRECC

3.2 Inform ACRECC of the Incident Type (Medical, Trauma, MVC, Haz-Mat etc.)

3.3 Responders should order MCI Resource Response (MCI Response) as soon as possible in order to get resources responding. This resource ordering can occur before an exact patient count is obtained.

3.4 Patient count approximations should be used as guidelines for initiating a specific MCI LEVEL and are not intended as a substitute for sound scene judgment

3.5 As soon as there is an approximate number of patients determined, the MCI Level should be declared

3.6 Immediately cancel assigned resource(s) when no longer required

3.7 Terminate the MCI through ACRECC when the MCI has been mitigated

4. RESOURCE ORDERING PRIORITY LIST

4.1 ALCO 911 Ambulances

4.2 ALCO BLS Permitted Ambulances

4.3 Mutual Aid from contiguous county(ies)

MCI RESOURCE ORDERING:

| **MCI Response 1** | Î5 Closest 911 Ambulances<br>Î1 EMS Supervisor<br>ÎEMS TAC channel assigned<br>Note: Immediately cancel assigned resource(s) when no longer required | ÎJurisdictional Fire Battalion Chief<br>ÎCounty EOA Provider Operations Supervisor<br>ÎLEMSA Duty Officer |
| **MCI Response 2**<br>Resources in MCI Response 2 are in addition to resources assigned in MCI Response 1 | Î5 Closest Ambulances<br>Î1 EMS Supervisor<br>Î1 DMSU<br>Note: Immediately cancel assigned resource(s) when no longer required | ÎAll County Fire Duty Chiefs |
| **MCI Response 3**<br>Resources in MCI Response 3 are in addition to resources assigned in MCI Response 2 | Î5 Closest Ambulances<br>Î1 EMS Supervisor<br>ÎConsider Air Assets<br>Note: Immediately cancel assigned resource(s) when no longer required | |
| **Additional Levels** | For Each Additional level:<br>Î5 Closest Ambulances<br>Î1 EMS Supervisor | |

MCI LEVELS:

| MCI Level | Approximate Patient Count |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| I | 5-14 Patients |
| II | 15-50 Patients |
| III | > 50 Patients |

5. MANAGEMENT OF MCI INCIDENTS AND PATIENT DISTRIBUTION

5.1 Once an MCI alert is determined by prehospital personnel, ACRECC will be notified and will "Initiate an MCI" under the Reddinet MCI module. ACRECC will immediately send an "ED Capacity poll and general notification" to the hospitals in Alameda County

5.2 For MCI Levels II & III, ACRECC will notify the EMS Duty Officer of the incident

5.3 Emergency responders shall perform triage using one of the following triage methods:
► The Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) algorithm for adults and JumpSTART for pediatrics
► The Sort, Assess, Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment / Transport (SALT) algorithm for patients in all age groups

5.3.1 Acuity based Triage colors for both Triage Tape and Triage Tags are universally accepted as Black (expectant / deceased), Red (immediate / life threatening,), Yellow (delayed / serious not life threatening), and Green (minor / walking wounded). Only Black, Red, Yellow, and green are acceptable triage colors

5.3.2 The use of colored "Triage Tape" upon initial contact with victims at the crisis site is preferred over Triage Tags to identify initial acuity. Triage tags should be used at the external Casualty Collection Point (CCP) outside the crisis site or applied to patients during transport. Acuity-guided transport of all patients shall occur in a coordinated and expedient manner

5.4 Hospital Poll: For MCI incidents involving 15+ patients, ACRECC will send a "bed capacity" poll to all hospitals in Alameda County to confirm bed availability

5.5 For the duration of the MCI, the Transportation Unit Leader under ICS will determine transportation methods and destinations

5.6 Whenever possible, patients should be transported to the most appropriate hospital without overloading one particular facility. Every effort will be made to transport trauma patients to a designated trauma hospital. In a Level II or III MCI, transport to a designated trauma center may not always be possible

5.7 First Round Destination Procedure may be implemented without prior authorization. All Alameda County receiving hospitals should prepare to receive patients, especially those in close proximity to the incident

First Round Destination Procedure:

| Non-Trauma patients** to each Alameda County receiving hospital (for a total of 6): | Trauma patients to each Alameda County Trauma Center (for a total of 7): |
|-------|-------|
| Two (2) "Immediate"<br>Four (4) "Delayed" and/or "Minor" | Three "Immediate"<br>Four (4) "Delayed" and/or "Minor" |

** e.g.: Medical incident, HazMat

5.8 ACRECC in conjunction with the incident command structure will track patient numbers, acuity and destinations in ReddiNet in as close to real-time as possible. ReddiNet will serve as the primary mechanism notifying receiving facilities of the number and acuity of incoming patients. Receiving hospitals will enter patient names and other relevant information into ReddiNet. This will facilitate patient accountability and reunification. On scene EMS Supervisors may also have the ability to enter information into ReddiNet

5.9 Verbal notification to hospitals: In a Level I MCI, transporting units should contact the receiving hospital enroute to give an abbreviated report on the patient(s) status and ETA. In a Level II or III MCI, if ReddiNet is unavailable or non-functional, a medical communications coordinator should be designated to notify receiving facilities of the number and acuity of incoming patients.

5.10 Incident Log - The Transportation Unit Leader should maintain an incident log

5.11 The on-scene Incident Commander or designee (ie. Medical Group Supervisor or Transportation Unit Leader) should contact ACRECC during and at the conclusion of the MCI to provide and reconcile patient tracking information to ensure accountability

6. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT - The Incident Commander has the overall responsibility for developing objectives and requesting the necessary resources required to mitigate the incident. There will be no self-dispatching. Clear communications between all involved agencies is imperative

6.1 The following items are MCI Management points to consider

► The three "T's" ensure that Triage, Treatment and Transport have been addressed

► Request resources through the Incident Commander in the early stages of the incident. Ensure adequate personnel and equipment

► Establish staging areas. Transport Units and/or other units that do not immediately have an assignment should report to the designated staging area and wait for instructions

► Use a one-way traffic pattern. Transport units should be staged to assure good access and egress from Loading Area

► All incoming units drop off required EMS equipment at a designated location

► County Disaster Trailers shall be requested through ACRECC

6.2 Use ICS identification vests. At a minimum the IC, Medical Group Supervisor, Triage and Treatment, and Transportation Unit Leader should be clearly identified with vests
