BRADYCARDIA

•Routine Medical Care
•Bradycardia: < 50 beats/minute, 2nd degree block, 3rd degree block
•Serious signs and symptoms:
  Î Acute altered mental status
  Î Hypotension
  Î On-going chest pain
  Î Other signs of shock
•Note:
  Î If utilizing Transcutaneous Pacing (TCP), verify mechanical capture and patient tolerance (see page 137)
  Î Use sedation with caution in the hypotensive patient (see page 131)
  Î If patient symptomatic and pacing not available, consider rapid transport
  Î Consider Hyperkalemia

**if patient is symptomatic, do not delay pacing to start an IV or wait for Atropine to take effect

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Maintain airway, assist breathing as needed
O2 – titrate to 94-99% SpO2
Monitor
IV/IO NS
Consider 12-lead if stable

**Signs or symptoms of poor perfusion caused by bradycardia?

√ Transcutaneous Pacing:
  Begin at 80bpm, 0 mA; increase in 10 mA increments until capture obtained then increase the output level by 10%. (see TCP page 136)

√ Consider:
  Sedation (see note above & sedation policy)

√ Consider:
  Pain Management – titrate to effect

√ Consider:
  Atropine 1 mg IV/IO while waiting for TCP. May repeat q 3-5 minutes to a total dose of 3 mg.

√ Consider:
  Epinephrine 0.5 mL (5 mcg) IV/IO, every 3 minutes, titrate to a SBP > 90

Push Dose Epinephrine mixing instructions:
›› Take Epinephrine 1 mg of 0.1 mg/ml preparation (Cardiac Epinephrine) and waste 9 ml of Epinephrine
›› In that syringe, draw 9 ml of normal saline from the patient's IV bag and shake well
›› Mixture now provides 10 ml of Epinephrine at a 0.01 mg/ml (10 mcg/ml) concentration

If capture maintained but patient remains symptomatic, consider:
√ Increase rate by 10 bpm to a max of 100bpm
√ Fluid challenge, particularly if evidence of right ventricular MI

Consider:
Base Physician consult if patient remains symptomatic
