CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) - PART 1 OF 2
Patient Care Policy (General)
Modified On: July 21, 2017

Scene safety: Make sure the environment is safe for rescuers and victims

Summary of High-Quality CPR Components for BLS Providers

| Component | Adults and Adolescents | Children (Age 1 Year to Puberty) | Infants (Age Less Than 1 Year, Excluding Newborns) |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Recognition of cardiac arrest | Check for responsiveness. No breathing or only gasping (ie, no normal breathing). No definite pulse felt within 10 seconds (Breathing and pulse check can be performed simultaneously in less than 10 seconds) | | |
| Activation of emergency response system | If you are alone with no mobile phone, leave the victim to activate the emergency response system and get the AED before beginning CPR. Otherwise, send someone and begin CPR immediately; use the AED as soon as it is available | Witnessed collapse: Follow steps for adults and adolescents on the left. Unwitnessed collapse: Give 2 minutes of CPR. Leave the victim to activate the emergency response system and get the AED. Return to the child or infant and resume CPR; use the AED as soon as it is available | |
| Compression-ventilation ratio without advanced airway | 1 or 2 rescuers: 30:2 | 1 rescuer: 30:2. 2 or more rescuers: 15:2 | |
| Compression-ventilation ratio with advanced airway | Continuous compressions at a rate of 100-120/min. Give 1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths/min) | | |
| Compression rate | 100-120/min | | |
| Compression depth | At least 2 inches (5 cm)* | At least one third AP diameter of chest. About 2 inches (5 cm) | At least one third AP diameter of chest. About 1½ inches (4 cm) |
| Hand placement | 2 hands on the lower half of the breastbone (sternum) | 2 hands or 1 hand (optional for very small child) on the lower half of the breastbone (sternum) | 1 rescuer: 2 fingers in the center of the chest, just below the nipple line. 2 or more rescuers: 2 thumb–encircling hands in the center of the chest, just below the nipple line |
| Chest recoil | Allow full recoil of chest after each compression; do not lean on the chest after each compression | | |
| Minimizing interruptions | Limit interruptions in chest compressions to less than 10 seconds | | |
| Defibrillation | Attach and use AED/Defibrillator as soon as available. Minimize interruptions in chest compressions before and after shock. Resume CPR beginning with compressions immediately after each shock | | |

*Compression depth should be no more than 2.4 inches (6 cm).

Abbreviations: AED, automated external defibrillator; AP, anteroposterior; CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

1. Minimize interruptions in chest compressions

2. Use a mechanical compression device whenever possible
2.1 Refer to manufacturer's instructions for specific information regarding mechanical CPR device
2.2 Upon ROSC, you must discontinue mechanical CPR device AND ResQPOD®

3. If advanced airway placement will interrupt chest compressions, providers may consider deferring insertion of the airway until the patient fails to respond to initial CPR and defibrillation attempts or demonstrates ROSC. (2015 AHA Guidelines)

4. Emphasis is on high quality, uninterrupted CPR - "push hard and fast" – allow for complete recoil

5. Two minutes CPR between drug doses

6. Once an advanced airway is established, give continuous chest compression without pauses for breaths. Avoid hyperventilation

7. Check rhythm q 2 minutes

8. Defibrillation: Device specific. While both monophasic and biphasic wave form defibrillators are acceptable, biphasic is preferred. Energy level is dependant upon the manufacturer

9. Newborn: Unresponsive, not breathing but has a pulse: 40-60 ventilations/minute. Compression/ventilation ratio: 3:1 (90 compressions : 30 ventilations per minute)

10. Unresolved or persistent arrest, look for and treat:
  Î Hypovolemia
  Î Hypoxia
  Î Hydrogen Ion (acidosis)
  Î Hypo-/Hyperkalemia
  Î Hypothermia
  Î Hypoglycemia (pediatric only)
  Î Tension pneumothorax
  Î Tamponade, cardiac
  Î Toxins
  Î Thrombosis, pulmonary
  Î Thrombosis, coronary

11. If patient regains ROSC, refer to Return of Spontaneous Circulation - ROSC (see page 48)
