CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) - PART 2 OF 2
Patient Care Policy (General)
Modified On: May 27, 2021

MECHANICAL CPR DEVICES:

12. PURPOSE: Effective and uninterrupted compressions are important for survival; AHA/ERC Guidelines for CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) 2005 emphasize the significance of compressions to provide critical blood flow to vital organs and in the end to increase the chances of a successful survival. Mechanical CPR allows for consistent, quality CPR that enables caregivers to focus on other aspects of resuscitation while maximizing effectiveness of therapeutic interventions

13. Indications:
► Use mechanical CPR devices wherever manual CPR is indicated
► IMPORTANT NOTE: If ROSC is obtained, mechanical CPR device must be discontinued

AutoPulse Contraindications:
Î ≤ 17 years of age
Î Patients with traumatic injury (wounds resulting from sudden physical injury or violence)

LUCAS Contraindications:
Î If it is not possible to position LUCAS safely or correctly on the patient's chest
Î Too small patient: if the LUCAS device alerts with 3 fast signals when lowering the Suction Cup, and you cannot enter the PAUSE mode or ACTIVE mode
Î Too large patient: If you cannot lock the Upper Part of LUCAS to the Back Plate without compressing the patient's chest

PIT CREW ROLES:

The roles and responsibilities detailed below are guidelines. There may be fewer personnel on hand for these roles.

• Tracks and notifies team of all monitor changes
• Completes EHR (with airway leader)
