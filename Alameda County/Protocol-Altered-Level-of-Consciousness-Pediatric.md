ALTERED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS

•Pediatric Routine Medical Care
•Naloxone should not be given as treatment for altered level of consciousness in the absence of respiratory depression (respiratory depression = rate of less than 12 breaths per minute) (see page 77)
•Consult with the Base Physician if the Blood Glucose reading is ≥ 60 mg% but hypoglycemia is suspected
•Use an LBRT to determine pediatric drug doses (Shown underlined on the algorithm)
•Note: Oral Glucose may be administered if the patient: 1) is able to hold head upright; 2) has a gag reflex; and, 3) can self-administer the medication
• Note: A newborn in this protocol is considered such for the first 30 minutes after being born.

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Maintain airway and adequate respirations.
O2 – titrate to 94‐99% SpO2
IV/ IO NS

Check Blood Glucose

Results < 60 mg mg/dL?
(<40 mg/dL for newly born)

NO → Reassess As needed
      Consider AEIOU – TIPS

YES ↓

IV/ IO Access?

YES → Dextrose 10% IV / IO
      See LBRT for dose
      
      May repeat LBRT dose until FSBS is >60 mg/dL or >40 mg/dL in newborns
      
      Adequate response?
      
      YES → Reassess As needed
            Consider AEIOU – TIPS
      
      NO → Reassess As needed
           Consider AEIOU – TIPS

NO → Oral Glucose
     (see note above)
     See LBRT for dose
     
     Or
     
     Glucagon
     See LRBT for dose
     
     Adequate response?
     
     YES → Reassess As needed
           Consider AEIOU – TIPS
     
     NO → Reassess As needed
          Consider AEIOU – TIPS
