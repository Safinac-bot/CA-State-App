SHOCK: HYPOVOLEMIC/CARDIOGENIC

•Routine Medical Care
•Shock - 2 or more of the following:
  Î Pulse > 120/minute
  Î Altered Mental Status
  Î BP < 90/systolic
  Î Pale, cool and/or diaphoretic skin signs
•Initiate early transport and treat en route, if appropriate.
•NOTE: A fluid bolus of up to 500 ml Normal Saline may be given to an adult patient in cardiogenic shock with clear lung sounds.
•If anaphylaxis suspected, see page 32
•If trauma suspected, see page 24
•If sepsis suspected, see page 52

Push Dose Epinephrine mixing instructions:
» Take Epinephrine 1 mg of 0.1 mg/ml preparation (Cardiac Epinephrine) and waste 9 ml of Epinephrine
» In that syringe, draw 9 ml of normal saline from the patient's IV bag and shake well
» Mixture now provides 10 ml of Epinephrine at a 0.01mg/ml (10 mcg/ml) concentration
