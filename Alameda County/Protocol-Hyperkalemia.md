HYPERKALEMIA
Patient Care Policy (General)
Modified On: July 24, 2018

Definition: Hyperkalemia is common in patients with severe renal failure (particularly those on dialysis) and should be suspected when these patients have weakness/fatigue, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or numbness/tingling. Hyperkalemia can lead to ECG changes that can ultimately result in life-threatening dysrhythmias. Treatment in the prehospital setting is based on the severity of the ECG, is temporizing until definitive treatment is achieved in the hospital, and aims to stabilize patients with the potential to arrest or become unstable

ECG Change(s) Associated with Hyperkalemia:
1. Peaked T Waves
2. Flattened-Absent P waves
3. Widened QRS complex
4. Sinusoidal pattern
5. Ventricular Fibrillation

Signs/symptoms of suspected Hyperkalemia:
► Weakness/Fatigue
► Nausea/Vomiting
► Chest Pain
► Palpitations
► Shortness of Breath
► Numbness/Tingling

► Cardiac Monitor
► 12 Lead ECG

Significant ECG Change(s)?

Yes:
► Calcium Chloride 1 gm slow IVP (over 2 min.)
   Note: flush IV tubing after administering CaCl to avoid precipitation
► Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IVP over 60 seconds
► Albuterol (only) 10-20mg by nebulizer or BVM
   Note: make sure to have a second IV line as other medications may not be compatible.

Cautions:
u Albuterol may exacerbate tachycardia
u Sodium Bicarbonate may exacerbate volume overload

No:
Reassess as needed
