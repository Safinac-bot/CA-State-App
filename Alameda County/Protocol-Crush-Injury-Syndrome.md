CRUSH INJURY SYNDROME

•Routine Medical Care
•Trauma Patient Care (see page 25)
•Note: Hypovolemia and hyperkalemia may occur, particularly with extended entrapment (usually > 4 hours). Once compression is released cellular toxins and potassium may be released into the body. Administering sodium bicarbonate alkalinizes the urine, controls hyperkalemia and acidosis

Î Crush Injury syndrome

Definition: Crush injury syndrome is the name given to the systemic manifestations of muscle crush injury and cell death. Crush injury syndrome should be suspected in patients with certain patterns of injury. Most patients in whom the syndrome develops have an extensive area of involvement such as a lower extremity and/or pelvis. It requires more involvement than just one hand or foot. The syndrome may develop after one hour in a severe crush situation, but usually requires 4 – 6 hours of compression for the processes that cause crush injury syndrome to occur.

Immediate care of crush injury patient (prior to release)
► Cardiac Monitor
► 12 Lead EKG
► Albuterol 10-20 mg via nebulizer
► Fluid resuscitation 20 ml/kg NS
► Pain Management – see pain management policy
   Adult: page 41
   Pediatric: page 66
► Use caution if other major traumatic injuries are suspected

Care of crush injury patient after release of compression

Hyperkalemia suspected?
(see note)

Yes:
Note: entrapment more than 4 hours and/or abnormal EKG findings – peaked "T" wave, absent "P" waves and widened "QRS"

► Calcium Chloride 1 gm slow IVP (over 2 min.)
   Note: flush IV tubing after administering CaCl to avoid precipitation
► Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IVP over 60 seconds
   Note: make sure to have a second IV line as other medications may not be compatible.

No:
Reassess as needed
