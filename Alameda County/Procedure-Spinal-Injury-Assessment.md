SPiNAl iNJURY ASSESSMENT

Procedures
Modified On: June 6, 2012

► Alameda County EMS is supporting efforts to decrease unnecessary immobilizations in the field and reduce the risks and complications associated with this procedure
► If the immobilization process is initiated prior to assessment, STOP and perform spine injury assessment to determine best course of action
► Studies show that immobilizing trauma victims may cause more harm than good to the patient. Penetrating trauma victims benefit most from rapid assessment and transport to a trauma center without spinal motion restriction (SMR)

1. INTRODUCTION:

1.1 Omit SMR if all assessment criteria are safely assessed and normal

1.2 Consider SMR for a patient who is suspected of having a traumatic unstable spinal column injury. Have high index of suspicion for pediatrics and patients with degenerative skeletal/connective tissue disorders (i.e. osteoporosis, elderly, previous spinal fractures, etc)

1.3 Victims of penetrating trauma (stabbings, gunshot wounds) to the head, neck, and/or torso SHOULD NOT receive SMR unless there is one or more of the following:
► Obvious neurologic deficit to the extremities
► Significant secondary blunt mechanism of injury (e.g.- fell down stairs after getting shot)
► Priapism
► Neurogenic shock
► Anatomic deformity to the spine secondary to injury

2. Pediatric Patients and Car Seats:

2.1 Infants restrained in a rear-facing car seat may be immobilized and extricated in the car seat. The child may remain in the car seat if the immobilization is secure and his/her condition allows (no signs of respiratory distress or shock)

2.2 Children restrained in a car seat (with a high back) may be immobilized and extricated in the car seat; however, once removed from the vehicle, the child should be placed in SMR

2.3 Children restrained in a booster seat (without a back) need to be extricated and immobilized following standard SMR procedures

3. Helmet removal: Safe and proper removal of the helmet should be done by two people following steps outlined in an approved trauma curriculum

ASSESSMENT FLOWCHART:

POTENTIAL FOR UNSTABLE SPINAL INJURY?

NO → OMIT SMR

YES ↓

A Reliable Patient is cooperative, sober and alert without:
ÎSignificant Distracting Injuries
ÎLanguage Barrier

► RELIABLE PATIENT?
► NORMAL SPINE EXAM?
► NORMAL MOTOR/SENSORY?

YES → Low-Risk Factors:
      • Simple rear-end MVC
      • Ambulatory at any time on scene
      • No neck pain at scene
      • Absence of midline cervical spine tenderness
      
      The low-risk factors above allow safe omission of SMR
      
      OMIT SMR

NO → High-Risk Factors:
     • Age ≥ 65
     • Meets Trauma Patient Criteria for Mechanism of Injury (Section 3)
     • Axial load to the head (e.g. - diving injury)
     • Numbness or tingling in extremities
     
     If any one of the high-risk factors above are present, strongly consider SMR
     
     POSSIBLE SPINE INJURY
     APPLY SMR

SPINAL PAIN/TENDERNESS
ÎPalpate vertebral column thoroughly

MOTOR/SENSORY EXAM:
ÎWrist or finger extension (both hands)
ÎPlantarflexion (both feet)
ÎDorsiflexion (both feet)
ÎCheck gross sensation in all extremities
ÎCheck for abnormal sensations to extremities (e.g. parathesias)
