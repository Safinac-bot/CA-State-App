1. VAGINAL BLEEDING (Abnormal bleeding between menses, during pregnancy, postpartum or post operative)

1.1 If postpartum, gently massage the fundus to decrease bleeding

1.2 Monitor vital signs frequently

2. SPONTANEOUS ABORTION

2.1 If fetus is > 20 weeks or 500 grams, see neonatal resuscitation protocol (page 73). If non-viable, save and transport any tissue or fetal remains

4. BREECH DELIVERY

4.1 Allow delivery to proceed passively until the baby's waist appears. Gently rotate the baby to a face down position and continue with the delivery

4.2 If the head does not readily deliver insert a gloved hand into the vagina to relieve pressure on the cord and create an air passage for the infant. Transport. Monitor vital signs and infant condition frequently

5. PROLAPSED CORD
