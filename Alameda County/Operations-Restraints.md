RESTRAINTS

1. Patient restraints are to be utilized only when necessary and in those situations where the patient is exhibiting behavior deemed to present danger to him/herself or to the field personnel. When restraints are used:

1.1 The minimum restraint necessary, to accomplish necessary patient care and safe transportation, should be utilized

1.2 Circulation to the extremities (distal to the restraints) will be evaluated q 5 minutes

1.3 Leather or soft restraints, designed specifically for patient restraint, are the only authorized method of restraining patients.

1.4 The restraints must not be placed in such a way as to preclude evaluation of the patient's medical status (e.g. airway, breathing, circulation) necessary patient care activities, or in any way jeopardize the patient medically

2. If the patient is under arrest and handcuffs are applied by law enforcement officers:

2.1 The patient will not be cuffed to the stretcher and a law enforcement officer shall accompany the patient in the ambulance, if the handcuffs are to remain applied

2.2 A law enforcement officer may elect to follow the ambulance in a patrol car to the receiving facility if the patient has been restrained on the gurney using leather or soft restraints
