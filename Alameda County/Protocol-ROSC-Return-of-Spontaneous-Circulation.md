RETURN OF SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION - ROSC

•Routine Medical Care
•Monitor for reoccurrence of arrest rhythm
•Transport patients with ROSC at any time to STEMI Center (except critical trauma patients)
•If appropriate, transport pediatric patients to Children's Hospital
•Note: Transcutaneous Pacing (page 137): Begin at 80 bpm, 0 mA; increase in increments of 10 mA until capture obtained then increase the output level by 10%. If capture maintained but patient remains symptomatic consider increasing the rate by 10 bpm, to a maximum of 100 bpm

TREATMENT FLOWCHART:

Monitor and support ABCs
► Confirm Palpable pulse and auscultated BP
► Monitor EtCO2 (maintain 35‐40 mmHg with PPV)
► O2 titrate to 94‐99%
► Perform 12‐LEAD
► Check blood glucose

      0.5ml (5 mcg) SIVP every 3 minutes, titrate to a SBP of ≥ 90
      
      Push Dose Epinephrine Mixing Instructions:
      → Take Epinephrine 1 mg of 0.1 mg/ml preparation (Cardiac Epinephrine) and waste 9ml of Epinephrine
      → In that syringe, draw 9 ml of normal saline from the patient's IV bag and shake well
      → Mixture now provides 10 ml of Epinephrine at a 0.01 mg/ml (10 mcg/ml) concentration

NO → Go to appropriate arm of this algorithm

Consider:
Epinephrine
0.5ml (5 mcg) SIVP every 3 minutes, titrate to a SBP of ≥ 90
