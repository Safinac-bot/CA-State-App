PAIN MANAGEMENT

•Routine Medical Care
•Pain management should be initiated as early as possible and before transport in the stable patient. Consider pain management prior to the manipulation of suspected fractures
•Document the level of pain prior to and after any interventions

BLS Interventions:
→ Positioning
→ Cold Pack(s)
→ Splinting
→ Coaching

Minor‐Moderate Pain:
Ketorolac ‐ IM/IV/IO
15 mg x 1 ‐ (No repeat dose)

Preferred first‐line medication for minor‐moderate pain and for patients with suspected kidney stones or chronic pain conditions. (May start with Fentanyl or Ketamine if appropriate or if Ketorolac is contraindicated)

Moderate‐Severe Pain:
Fentanyl
IV/IO: 1 mcg/kg (50‐100 mcg) Slow push. Repeat q 5min PRN to a max. cumulative dosage of 200 mcg
IM/IN: 1 mcg/kg (50‐100 mcg) Repeat q 10min PRN to a max. cumulative dosage of 200 mcg

Base contact required if contraindications are present or >200 mcg is needed

OR

Ketamine
IV/IO: 0.3 mg/kg in 100ml of NS/D5W Slow IV Infusion over 10 minutes. (max. dose is 30 mg, no repeat)
IM/IN 0.3 mg/kg (max. dose is 30 mg, no repeat)

Ketorolac Considerations:

Contraindications:
■ Patients who meet Trauma Criteria
■ NSAID Allergy (e.g. Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Aspirin)
■ Pregnancy
■ History of: GI Bleed, Ulcers, Renal disease
■ Current anticoagulant use

Note:
Standards doses of Fentanyl OR Ketamine may be administered if Ketorolac is ineffective

Fentanyl & Ketamine Considerations:

DO NOT CO‐ADMINISTER FENTANYL AND KETAMINE

Patient Monitoring:
Continuous monitoring of the patient's LOC and respiratory status via direct observation/ETCO2/SpO2, etc is required.

Contraindications:
■ Decreased respiratory rate
■ Altered mental status/LOC
■ Suspected Traumatic Brain Injury

Notes:
Consider lower doses of Fentanyl for older adults
Have Naloxone readily available when administering Fentanyl
Ketorolac may be administered if Fentanyl or Ketamine is ineffective
